  [Verse 1]
  I was twelve with a wish on a winter night, 
  Snowflakes dancing in the Christmas lights. 
  I found a beagle pup with a ribbon on her ear, 
  My heart beat fast like finally, she’s here. 
  Named her Amber for the warmth in her eyes, 
  Two little shadows in the winter night, 
  Growing up felt big, but she made it light, 
  Her soft footsteps made the world feel right.
  
  [Pre Chorus]
  Through every change, every stumble I pushed through, 
  Amber was the one thing I could always turn to.
  
  [Chorus]
  Oh, Amber, you were my first forever, 
  Running through the seasons like a wild heartbeat. 
  Oh, Amber, we grew up together, 
  Every memory glowing in your soft‑brown eyes, 
  And the world kept changing, but you stayed you— 
  The rhythm in my life I always ran back to. Amber… 
  I never knew How much of me was you.
  
  [Verse 2]
  High school halls and a brand‑new crush, 
  First slow dance, first kiss, first rush. 
  He held my hand, but you held my truth, 
  Teaching me love the way you taught me youth. 
  Then college came with its miles and fears, 
  Quiet dorm rooms and long‑distance tears. 
  But every break I’d run home wanting more, 
  To find you waiting on the kitchen floor.
  
  [Pre Chorus]
  Your muzzle graying, but your tail still wagging, 
  Like every bit of strength you had was meant for me.
  
  [Chorus]
  Oh, Amber, you were my first forever, 
  Running through the seasons like a wild heartbeat. 
  Oh, Amber, we grew up together, 
  Every memory glowing in your soft‑brown eyes, 
  And the world kept changing, but you stayed you— 
  The rhythm in my life I always ran back to. Amber… 
  I never knew How much of me was you.
  
  [Bridge]
  I held you close on that quiet night, 
  Whispered “thank you” through the fading light. 
  And when the morning came, the house felt wrong— 
  Too still, too quiet, missing your warmth. 
  I didn’t know how to breathe without you, 
  Didn’t know how to start something new.
  
  [Verse 3]
  Then he showed up with a trembling bow, 
  Little beagle eyes saying “it’s okay to let go.” 
  Placed her gently in my shaking arms, 
  A tiny heartbeat stitching up the old scars, 
  Named her Aria for the light she sparked, 
  A soft little promise that love never fades.
  
  [Chorus]
  Oh, Amber, you were my first forever, 
  Running through the seasons like a wild heartbeat. 
  Oh, Amber, we grew up together, 
  Every memory glowing in your soft‑brown eyes. 
  And Aria, you’re the love that follows, 
  Filling up the spaces where the grief still pools. 
  Two beagle pups in the story I knew— 
  Amber taught me love, and Aria carries it through. 
  Amber… I’ll always be all the love you left in me.
