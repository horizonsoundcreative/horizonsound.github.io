lyrics: |
  [Verse]
  You say the world is a place to explore,
  You get a thrill from the race and the roar.
  Then you’re in it,
  We’re so in it…
  Then suddenly you leave—
  A summer you swore you’d never forget,
  When fall comes around, you don’t feel it yet.
  How do I take that? 
  I’m so displaced now,
  When you leave me.
  
  [Chorus]
  You know
  I can't see all around the world
  Can't see all around the world without you
  (All around the world)
  Can't see all around the world
  You know
  I can't see all around the world
  Can't see all around the world without you
  (All around the world)
  Can't see all around the world
  
  [Verse]
  I have a routine when I put on my face,
  Try to cover it up so I don’t look the same.
  Then it’s foundation,
  Eyes,
  Lips…
  Then I’m brand new.
  But you show up saying, “Hey,
  I’ve got someone in mind for you today —
  The one you think of
  All of the time,
  Who would take you out,
  Who would treat you right…
  The way he should.”
  
  [Bridge]
  Maybe I was chasing you too far,
  Running circles ’round your shooting star.
  But every place you showed me how to see
  Is still a map that leads me back to me.
  
  [Chorus]
  You know
  I can see all around the world,
  But it’s different than it was with you.
  (All around the world)
  I’m learning what is true.
  You know
  I can see all around the world,
  Even if I miss the view I knew.
  (All around the world)
  I’m finding something new.
  
  [Outro]
  All around the world…
  I’m still moving.
  All around the world…
  I’m still choosing.
  All around the world…
  I’m finding me.
