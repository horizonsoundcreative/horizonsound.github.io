title: "A Way Back Trilogy"

description: >
  A three-part emotional arc exploring silence, self-worth, and the courage
  to choose yourself — or choose your way back home. Told from two
  perspectives, this trilogy follows the quiet unraveling of a relationship,
  the rediscovery of identity, and the moment two people decide whether to
  walk away or walk toward each other again.
