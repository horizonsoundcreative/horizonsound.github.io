lyrics: |
  [Verse 1]
  This road's a lil' unsteady
  My bags are kinda heavy
  Weighed down with all the petty things I've held
  But I won't let it break me
  These cuts won't overtake me
  I know the road is long
  But I'll stay strong
  
  [Pre-chorus]
  'Cause I know that all this shit won't last forever
  I know there's something better
  I know I'm made for something more
  
  [Chorus]
  So hold on
  Hold on
  Hold on
  Hold on
  
  [Verse 2]
  This town has no more answers
  I'm losing all my chances
  Can't stay here waiting
  Standin' still too long
  I've gotta get to leavin'
  I know my heart is beatin'
  I've heard that if I stay
  It fades away
  
  [Prechorus]
  But I know that all this shit won't last forever
  I know there's something better
  I know I'm made for something more
  
  [Chorus]
  So hold on
  Hold on
  Hold on
  Hold on
  
  [Bridge]
  When the night gets colder
  And the weight pulls on your shoulder
  When the world feels like it’s crashing in again
  Take a breath and face it
  You’re stronger when you chase it
  Every ending is a place to start again
  
  [Chorus]
  So hold on
  Hold on
  You’re closer than you know now
  Don’t let the fear take hold now
  Hold on
  Hold on
  The hardest part is over
  You’re stepping into clover
  Hold on
