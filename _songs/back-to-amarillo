  Official audio for “Back to Amarillo” by Horizon Sound.

  “Back to Amarillo” is a warm, vintage‑inspired 1950s country‑western track built on twangy acoustic guitars, upright bass, and a smooth baritone vocal. The production leans nostalgic and cinematic, capturing the dusty‑trail charm of classic cowboy storytelling. With its gentle swing, melodic lift, and old‑school reverb, the song feels like a lost record from the golden era of western ballads.
  
  This song follows a drifting cowboy who never stays in one town for long — except Amarillo. There’s a girl there who knows his order, knows his name, and makes the dusty road feel a little less lonely. He’s not ready to settle down, but every time he crosses that county line, he feels the pull of something like home. “Back to Amarillo” is a romantic, heartfelt look at the kind of love that keeps a wanderer coming back.

lyrics: |
  [Verse 1]
  I’ve been ridin’ dusty trails,
  chasin’ cattle, chasin’ time.
  Never stay in one town long,
  but there’s one that draws me near,
  ’Cause there’s a girl in Amarillo
  with a smile that pulls me in,
  and every time I cross that county line,
  I fall for her again.
  
  [Chorus]
  I keep ridin’ back to Amarillo,
  Down that same old dusty trail.
  I ain’t one for settlin’ down,
  but she feels a lot like home.
  And every time I tip my hat
  and see her standin’ in the door,
  I swear my boots get heavier —
  I don’t wanna ride no more.
  
  [Verse 2]
  She pours coffee at the diner,
  knows my order, knows my name.
  Says I’m always passin’ through here,
  but she’s always glad I came.
  We talk dreams beneath the awning
  while the Texas moon hangs low,
  and though I leave at break of dawn,
  my heart don’t wanna go.
  
  [Chorus]
  I keep ridin’ back to Amarillo,
  Down that same old dusty trail.
  I ain’t one for settlin’ down,
  but she feels a lot like home.
  And every time I tip my hat
  and see her standin’ in the door,
  I swear my boots get heavier —
  I don’t wanna ride no more.
  
  [Bridge]
  Maybe someday I’ll stop wanderin’,
  hang my hat beside her bed.
  But for now I’m just a drifter
  With her smile lightin’ up my way.
  
  [Chorus]
  I keep ridin’ back to Amarillo,
  Down that same old dusty trail.
  I ain’t one for settlin’ down,
  but she feels a lot like home.
  And every time I tip my hat
  and see her standin’ in the door,
  I swear my boots get heavier —
  I don’t wanna ride no more.
