lyrics: |
  [Intro]
  We gave it all, but sometimes love just fades,
  Two honest hearts walking different ways.
  No hard feelings, just a quiet truth—
  Now we’re learning how to start brand new.
  
  [Verse 1]
  Woke up easy, sunlight dancing on my face,
  Coffee on the counter, quiet filling up the space.
  Didn’t know I missed the way the mornings used to feel—
  Guess being alone is finally helping me heal.
  
  [Pre Chorus]
  I’m not running from the memories we made,
  Just realizing I’m better with a little more space.
  A little breath, a little room to see—
  And I’m starting to come back to me.
  
  [Chorus]
  I’m finally breathing, letting my soul shine,
  Finding pieces of myself I left behind,
  I’m choosing me tonight.
  (I’m choosing me tonight.)
  No hard feelings, just a little more peace,
  Learning to embrace the girl I used to be—
  Yeah, I’m choosing me.
  
  [Verse 2]
  I’ve been laughing at the little things again,
  Dancing in the kitchen, calling up old friends.
  Didn’t know how much I’d lost along the way—
  Now I’m taking back the colors I let fade.
  
  [Pre Chorus]
  It’s not about the love we couldn’t keep,
  It’s waking up to things I’d put off too long.
  A little hope, a little clarity—
  And I’m finally where I’m meant to be.
  
  [Chorus]
  I’m finally breathing, letting my soul shine,
  Finding pieces of myself I left behind,
  I’m choosing me tonight.
  (I’m choosing me tonight.)
  No hard feelings, just a little more peace,
  Learning to embrace the girl I used to be—
  Yeah, I’m choosing me.
  
  [Bridge]
  I’m not closing any doors, just opening my own,
  Learning I can walk a little farther on my own.
  Got a little stronger, got a little light—
  And I’m holding onto what feels right.
  
  [Chorus]
  I’m finally breathing, letting my soul shine,
  Finding pieces of myself I left behind,
  I’m choosing me tonight.
  (I’m choosing me tonight.)
  No hard feelings, just a little more peace,
  Learning to embrace the girl I used to be—
  Yeah, I’m choosing me tonight.
  I’m choosing me.
  
  [Outro]
  We’re moving on, and maybe that’s alright,
  Two honest hearts stepping into new light.
  No hard feelings, just a quiet release—
  And we’re both finding our own kind of peace.
