  Official audio for "Hold On (Revised)" by Horizon Sound.
  
  “Hold On (Revised)” is an upbeat 90s‑inspired pop track driven by bright female vocals, steady rhythmic drums, warm acoustic layers, and a hopeful, energetic feel. Smooth synths and light guitar textures blend with a motivational, melodic groove to create a song that lifts you up and keeps you moving forward.
  
  This revised version brings a cleaner vocal delivery, tightened phrasing, and a more polished emotional arc — while preserving the heart of the original.

It’s a reminder that even when the road feels winding, you’re stronger than the moment you’re in — and you’re made for something more.

  [Intro]
  Hold on
  Hold on
  
  [Verse 1]
  This road’s a little winding
  My bags keep on reminding
  They’re weighed down by the petty things I keep
  But I won’t let it break me
  These cuts won’t overtake me
  I know the road is long
  But I’ll stay strong
  
  [Pre-chorus]
  'Cause I know that all this shit won't last forever
  I know there's something better
  I know I'm made for something more
  
  [Chorus]
  So hold on
  Hold on
  Hold on
  Hold on
  
  [Verse 2]
  This town has nothing for me
  I’m done with who it made me
  I can’t just stand here waiting, not today
  I’ve gotta get to leavin’
  I know my heart is beatin’
  I’ve heard that if I stay, it all just fades away
  
  [Prechorus]
  But I know that all this shit won't last forever
  I know there's something better
  I know I'm made for something more
  
  [Chorus]
  So hold on
  Hold on
  Hold on
  Hold on
  
  [Bridge]
  When the night gets colder
  And the weight pulls on your shoulder
  When the world feels like it’s crashing in again
  Take a breath and face it
  You’re stronger when you chase it
  Every ending is a place to start again
  
  [Chorus]
  So hold on
  Hold on
  You’re closer than you know now
  Don’t let the fear take hold now
  Hold on
  Hold on
  The hardest part is over
  You’re stepping into clover
  Hold on
