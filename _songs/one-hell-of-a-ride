lyrics: |
  [Verse 1]
  Hit London city in a rust‑bucket ride,
  Road dust on our boots, trouble in our eyes.
  The clerk at the counter mutters, “Oh no,”
  ‘Cause he’s seen our kind, the chaos we sow.
  We ain’t built for quiet, ain’t wired to behave,
  Just chasin’ that wild streak the good Lord gave.
  
  [Pre‑Chorus]
  Last night’s just a haze we can’t recall,
  But the crowd keeps roarin’, so we give ’em our all.
  
  [Chorus]
  ’Cause we’re a long‑haired band on a runaway ride,
  Burnin’ up the map with the wind at our side.
  Raise a glass, raise some hell, let the good times roll,
  Leavin’ miles of trouble behind us wherever we go.
  Yeah, we live loud, love wild, and sleep when we’re old.
  
  [Verse 2]
  From Tokyo to Rio, we’re raisin’ up dust,
  Hotel staff bangin’ like they don’t trust us.
  Hallway’s a mess now, lamps shattered on the floor,
  We swear we’ll behave — then we’re breakin’ down the door.
  There’s a grin in the shadows, someone hummin’ our tune,
  And we’re gone with the sunrise, leavin’ way too soon.
  
  [Pre‑Chorus]
  Every night’s a story with a twist at the end,
  But the road keeps callin’ like a long‑lost friend.
  
  [Chorus]
  ’Cause we’re a long‑haired band on a runaway ride,
  Burnin’ up the map with the wind at our side.
  Raise a glass, raise some hell, let the good times roll,
  Leavin’ miles of trouble behind us wherever we go.
  Yeah, we live loud, love wild, and sleep when we’re old.
  
  [Bridge]
  Some folks say we’re reckless, some say we’re blessed,
  But we just keep movin’ and doin’ our best.
  If the night gets rowdy, well, that’s how it goes —
  You can’t cage a wildfire that’s out of control.
  
  [Pre‑Chorus]
  We’ve been raisin’ hell nightly from coast to coast,
  And we’re hitting’ that stage givin’ everything we’ve got.
  
  [Final Chorus]
  ’Cause we’re a long‑haired band on a runaway ride,
  Burnin’ up the map with the wind at our side.
  Raise a glass, raise some hell, let the good times roll,
  Leavin’ miles of trouble behind us wherever we go.
  Yeah, we live loud, love wild, and sleep when we’re old.
  
  [Outro]
  Dust in the rearview, moon on the chrome,
  We ain’t slowin’ down till the good Lord calls us home.
