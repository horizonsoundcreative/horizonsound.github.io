lyrics: |
  [Verse]
  You let me down again,
  I thought you were the one.
  You swore I was your only,
  But now I see I wasn’t.
  I thought you’d make it right,
  But you just let it slide.
  So here I am again tonight,
  Staring at the mirror like it’s asking why.
  
  [Chorus]
  So—
  I take my time with my foundation
  Darken up my eyes and fill in my lips
  In a few minutes
  I'll be someone new again
  I'll be new again
  And you won’t recognize the girl you missed.
  
  [Verse 2]
  I step outside, the air feels clean,
  A new car waits like in a dream.
  He’s always seen me through the haze,
  Now he’s here to take me far away.
  He treats me like I’m worth the fight,
  Not just a name you said at night.
  And all this time I thought he’d stay
  Just a friend — but not today.
  
  [Chorus]
  So—
  I take my time with my foundation
  Darken up my eyes and fill in my lips
  In a few minutes
  I'll be someone new again
  I'll be new again
  And you won’t recognize the girl you missed.
  
  [Bridge]
  Now I’m new again,
  Not broken, not pretend.
  I found the strength you never saw,
  And I’m not coming back again.
  
  [Chorus]
  I take my time with my foundation
  Darken up my eyes and fill in my lips
  In a few minutes
  I'll be someone new again
  I'll be new again
  And you won’t recognize the girl you missed.
  
  [Outro]
  Now I'm new again
  (Now I'm new again)
  Now I'm new again
  (Now I'm new again)
  Now I'm new again
  (Now I'm new again)
  Now I’m new again… and I won’t be yours again.
