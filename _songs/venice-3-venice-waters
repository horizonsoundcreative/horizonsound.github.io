lyrics: |
  [Intro]
  I tucked my passport in the drawer, 
  told myself that dream was done. 
  Our lives had drifted far apart, 
  Venice didn’t feel like ours.
  
  [Verse 1]
  We were talking over coffee, laughing at how fast life flies, 
  how someday turned to decades in the blink of tired eyes. 
  You said, “Remember Venice? — We always meant to go,” 
  I said, “Yeah… who knows, maybe someday.” 
  But then you smiled and said, “Hey… what if someday finally comes?” 
  Two women realizing some dreams don’t fade — they wait.
  
  [Pre Chorus]
  Your husband grinned and told us, “Book it — you both deserve the break.” 
  We didn’t know until the airport he’d bumped us to first class. 
  
  [Chorus]
  We finally rode those Venice waters, 
  we finally chased the sun across the sea. 
  Two grown women keeping a solemn promise— 
  Now our passports bear the stamp we dreamed we’d see. 
  Twenty years late, but it still feels right — 
  No longer kids, but the world feels great,  
  Someday is here — Venice waters.
  
  [Verse 2]
  We wandered through the landmarks, 
  strolling down Venice streets—
  Took a gondola at sunset 
  as the city lights came on— 
  We talked about the lives we built 
  and how they led us different ways... 
  Remembered the girls we were, 
  the women we became— 
  How some dreams take a lifetime… 
  but they’re worth it just the same.
  
  [Pre Chorus]
  We took photos on the bridges, 
  laughed until our sides were sore. 
  Felt fourteen again in a city 
  where imagination soars. 
  This time together is precious— 
  the kind you feel in your bones, 
  the kind that whispers softly, 
  “You finally made it home.”
  
  [Chorus]
  We finally rode those Venice waters, 
  we finally chased the sun across the sea. 
  Two grown women keeping a solemn promise— 
  Now our passports bear the stamp we dreamed we’d see. 
  Twenty years late, but it still feels right — 
  No longer kids, but the world feels great,  
  Someday is here — Venice waters.  
  
  [Bridge]
  All those years of “maybe someday,” 
  all those pages left unturned — 
  we let the world decide the timing, 
  and then it opened up the door. 
  And suddenly the dream we made 
  wasn’t a dream anymore.
  
  [Chorus]
  We finally rode those Venice waters, 
  we finally chased the sun across the sea. 
  Two grown women keeping a solemn promise— 
  Now our passports bear the stamp we dreamed we’d see. 
  Twenty years late, but it still feels right — 
  No longer kids, but the world feels great,  
  Someday is here — Venice waters.
  
  [Outro]
  On the flight home we compared passports, 
  smiling like we used to — 
  two matching stamps, 
  the dream we carried finally met. 
  And as the plane touched down, 
  you whispered, “Next time… where should we go?”
