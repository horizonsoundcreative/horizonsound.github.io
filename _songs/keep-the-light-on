lyrics: |
  [Verse 1]
  Woke up feeling kinda shaky,
  World was lookin’ a little hazy,
  But I’m done with letting shadows call the shots.
  Pulled myself together slowly,
  Told the mirror, “Girl, you know me,
  You’ve been through worse and it’s never made you stop.”
  
  [Pre‑Chorus]
  And I know the storm is only passing through,
  Every cloud breaks open to a better view.
  
  [Chorus]
  So keep the light on,
  Keep the light on,
  Even when the night feels way too long.
  Keep the light on,
  Keep the light on,
  You’re stronger than the things you’re running from.
  
  [Verse 2]
  Steppin’ out into the sunlight,
  Feels like everything’s aligning,
  My wins are adding up a little more each day.
  Every moment feels much brighter,
  Every step is feeling lighter,
  Didn’t think I would ever feel this way.
  
  [Pre‑Chorus]
  And I know the storm is only passing through,
  Every cloud breaks open to a better view.
  
  [Chorus]
  So keep the light on,
  Keep the light on,
  Even when the night feels way too long.
  Keep the light on,
  Keep the light on,
  You’re stronger than the things you’re running from.
  
  [Bridge]
  When the road gets quiet,
  And your thoughts run riot,
  Embrace the faith that’s kept you moving all this time.
  You don’t need perfection,
  Just a little more direction—
  You can always reclaim what’s left of time.
  
  [Chorus]
  So keep the light on,
  Keep the light on,
  You’re closer than you think, just carry on.
  Keep the light on,
  Keep the light on,
  The hardest part is done, you’re moving on.
  
  [Outro]
  So keep the light on,
  Keep the light on,
  Even when the night feels way too long.
  Keep the light on.
