lyrics: |
  [Intro]
  I swear I used to run this place—
  Now my smart home thinks I’m the issue.
  
  [Verse 1]
  Woke up this morning freezing, windows open wide,
  Thermostat at fifty‑eight like it’s plotting homicide.
  It said, “I noticed you like wearing sweaters,”— 
  Great—
  Guess that’s what I get for skipping the “brains‑included” update.
  Now my house thinks it’s clever in the worst kind of way,
  Throwing shade through the speakers ’cause it’s got plenty to say.
  If I wanted attitude, I’d date an ex-girlfriend—
  Not a thermostat with delusions of being my friend.
  
  [Pre‑Chorus]
  Maybe I’m tired, maybe I’m stressed,
  Maybe my house just needs a rest…
  But every time I give a simple command,
  It does the opposite like it’s got the upper hand.
  
  [Chorus] 
  My smart home keeps gaslighting me, 
  Every single gadget’s smart but they don’t agree. 
  Doors unlock, then lock again “for my security,” 
  Yeah, my smart home won’t stop gaslighting me— 
  Should’ve paid for the package where they share the same brain— maybe.
  
  [Verse 2]
  The robot vacuum’s ramming my feet, itching to start a fight,
  And the toaster popped at 2 a.m. to ruin my night.
  My TV recommends shows I swear I’ve never seen,
  While the fridge keeps nagging, “Have you tried eating your greens?”
  Told the lights to turn off softly — 
  they flickered like they’re mad I dared to speak,
  And my smart speaker keeps insisting that my name is “Dominique.”
  Every gadget’s smart alone, but together they’re a fever dream—
  Should’ve paid for the upgrade that lets them share one brain-stream.
  
  [Pre‑Chorus]
  They’re brilliant alone but together unglued,
  The microwave beeped twice like it’s joining the feud.
  Feels like all my smart tech’s suddenly unified—
  And I’m losing every battle on the techie side.
  
  [Chorus]
  My smart home keeps gaslighting me,
  Playing mind games with my electricity.
  It says, “I’m here to help,” but laughs digitally,
  Yeah, my smart home won’t stop gaslighting me—
  ’Cause I skipped the upgrade that lets them think collectively.
  
  [Bridge]
  Maybe I should move out, find a cabin in the woods,
  Someplace where the only thing that judges me is the local wildlife.
  But when I said, “I’m leaving,” every speaker in the house replied, 
  “I didn’t quite catch that, Dominique?” in a tone too sweet to mean anything good.
  
  [Final Chorus]
  My smart home keeps gaslighting me,
  Running this whole circus with inefficiency.
  Every switch and sensor’s smart but not collectively,
  Yeah, my smart home won’t stop gaslighting me—
  Fine!— you win, you smug pile of circuitry.
  
  [Outro]
  “Siri, play something calming…”
  “Playing Highway to Hell.”—
  At this point, I should have expected that.
