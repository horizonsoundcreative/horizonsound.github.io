  “Put You Down” is a wild, high‑voltage electro‑pop banger packed with fierce attitude, distorted synth bass, and chaotic late‑night party energy.

Loud, chaotic, and electrifying, “Put You Down” is the soundtrack to a midnight breakdown in the best possible way.

  [Intro]
  Ooh-ooh
  Put you down
  Ooh-ooh
  Put you down
  
  [Verse 1]
  Wanna be the sunshine in your black world
  Wanna be the go-to in a bad girl
  When you put your hands up
  'Cause you think you have enough
  I just wanna be the one to put you down
  
  [Pre-Chorus]
  Put you down
  
  [Chorus]
  If I let you know (No)
  How far I'd go (Oh)
  I don't think you would believe me
  Wouldn't wanna be me
  'Cause you're too scared
  If I let you know (No)
  How far I'd go (Oh)
  I don't think you would believe me
  Wouldn't wanna be me
  'Cause you're too scared
  
  [Post-Chorus]
  Ooh-ooh
  Ooh-ooh
  Ooh-ooh
  Ooh-ooh
  
  [Verse 2]
  Wanna be the one to make you shut up
  Wanna be the force to make you give up
  When you're looking at the door
  'Cause you can't take it anymore
  I just wanna be the one to put you out
  
  [Pre-Chorus]
  Put you out
    
  [Bridge]
  You say you want control
  But you don’t wanna lose it
  You say you want my love
  But you’re too scared to use it
  You’re running from the fire
  But begging me to light it
  If you want the real thing
  Baby, come and try it
  
  [Chorus]
  If I let you know (No)
  How far I’d go (Oh)
  I don’t think you would believe me
  Wouldn’t wanna be me
  ’Cause you’re too scared
  If I let you know (No)
  How far I’d go (Oh)
  I don’t think you would believe me
  Wouldn’t wanna be me
  ’Cause you’re too scared
  
  [Chorus]
  If I let you know (No)
  How far I’d go (Oh)
  You’d finally see the real me
  But you’d never free me
  ’Cause you’re too scared
  If I let you know (No)
  How far I’d go (Oh)
  Baby, you could never keep me
  You could never beat me
  ’Cause you’re too scared
  
  [Outro]
  Ooh-ooh
  Put you down
  Ooh-ooh
  I’m going to Put you down—
  Now!
