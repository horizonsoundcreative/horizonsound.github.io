      <p>[Verse]
      In a crowded delivery room
      A nurse says to the new mother “Congratulations, It's a boy."
      But if they had been listening
      They would have heard her little voice saying
      "Mama, It's me. It's your daughter, the one you always wanted."
      It's been a journey to here, but she's here now
      Laying in your arms—
      A new beginning</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]
      But it all began with that quiet little voice that always knew who she was
      And it was the courage to listen that got her here today</p>
  
      <p>[Verse]
      And that quiet little voice turned into hormones that slowly started to soften her features
      She began to see herself for the first time
      Her new reflection began to match her soul
      That quiet little voice was replaced with the confidence to speak up and be heard
      The confidence to finally say yes to the boy that she had been seeing and to love him fully
      To let herself be loved
      The quiet little voice turned into their loud declaration of love</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]
      And that love turned into an engagement
      And the engagement will turn into a marriage
      And one day
      That marriage will bring forth new life</p>
  
      <p>[Verse]
      In a crowded delivery room
      A nurse will say to her
      "Congratulations
      It's a girl."
      But she'll already know
      Because she learned a long time ago to always listen to that quiet little voice
      Because it was that voice that knew the whole time
      And it was that voice that got her here today</p>
  
      <p>[Outro]
      A new beginning</p>

    lyrics_html: |
      <p>[Intro]
      We gave it all, but sometimes love just fades,
      Two honest hearts walking different ways.
      No hard feelings, just a quiet truth—
      Now we’re learning how to start brand new.</p>
  
      <p>[Verse 1]
      Woke up slower, silence hanging in the room,
      Trying to make peace with the things I can’t undo.
      Realized I took us for granted on the way—
      Now I’m learning how to face myself today.</p>
  
      <p>[Pre Chorus]
      I’m not holding onto what we couldn’t save,
      Just thinking ’bout the times I wasn’t there.
      A little space, a little honesty—
      And I’m feeling more like me.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]
      I’m opening up, changing priorities,
      Learning to see what others need.
      I’m choosing me tonight.
      (I’m choosing me tonight.)
      No hard feelings, just a little more truth—
      For me to change, I’ve got to grow.
      Yeah, I’m— choosing me.</p>
  
      <p>[Verse 2]
      I’ve been feeling you every place I go,
      But it’s fading fast as I learn to grow.
      I’m still haunted, but I can see the light,
      Didn’t expect this strength to feel so right.</p>
  
      <p>[Pre Chorus]
      It’s not about the love we couldn’t keep,
      It’s learning to be the man I’m meant to be.
      A little truth, a little clarity—
      And I’m slowly finding my way back to me.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]
      I’m opening up, changing priorities,
      Learning to see what others need.
      I’m choosing me tonight.
      (I’m choosing me tonight.)
      No hard feelings, just a little more truth—
      For me to change, I’ve got to grow.
      Yeah, I’m— choosing me.</p>
  
      <p>[Bridge]
      I wasn’t there in the ways I meant to be,
      But I understand now why I pulled away.
      Got a little wiser, got a little light—
      And I’m leaning in to what feels right.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]
      I’m opening up, changing priorities,
      Learning to see what others need.
      I’m choosing me tonight.
      (I’m choosing me tonight.)
      No hard feelings, just a little more truth—
      For me to change, I’ve got to grow.
      Yeah, I’m choosing me tonight.
      I’m— choosing me.</p>
  
      <p>[Outro]
      We’re moving on, and maybe that’s alright,
      Two honest hearts stepping into new light.
      No hard feelings, just a quiet release—
      And we’re both finding our own kind of peace.</p>

      <p>[Intro]
      We gave it all, but sometimes love just fades,
      Two honest hearts walking different ways.
      No hard feelings, just a quiet truth—
      Now we’re learning how to start brand new.</p>
  
      <p>[Verse 1]
      Woke up easy, sunlight dancing on my face,
      Coffee on the counter, quiet filling up the space.
      Didn’t know I missed the way the mornings used to feel—
      Guess being alone is finally helping me heal.</p>
  
      <p>[Pre Chorus]
      I’m not running from the memories we made,
      Just realizing I’m better with a little more space.
      A little breath, a little room to see—
      And I’m starting to come back to me.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]
      I’m finally breathing, letting my soul shine,
      Finding pieces of myself I left behind,
      I’m choosing me tonight.
      (I’m choosing me tonight.)
      No hard feelings, just a little more peace,
      Learning to embrace the girl I used to be—
      Yeah, I’m choosing me.</p>
  
      <p>[Verse 2]
      I’ve been laughing at the little things again,
      Dancing in the kitchen, calling up old friends.
      Didn’t know how much I’d lost along the way—
      Now I’m taking back the colors I let fade.</p>
  
      <p>[Pre Chorus]
      It’s not about the love we couldn’t keep,
      It’s waking up to things I’d put off too long.
      A little hope, a little clarity—
      And I’m finally where I’m meant to be.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]
      I’m finally breathing, letting my soul shine,
      Finding pieces of myself I left behind,
      I’m choosing me tonight.
      (I’m choosing me tonight.)
      No hard feelings, just a little more peace,
      Learning to embrace the girl I used to be—
      Yeah, I’m choosing me.</p>
  
      <p>[Bridge]
      I’m not closing any doors, just opening my own,
      Learning I can walk a little farther on my own.
      Got a little stronger, got a little light—
      And I’m holding onto what feels right.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]
      I’m finally breathing, letting my soul shine,
      Finding pieces of myself I left behind,
      I’m choosing me tonight.
      (I’m choosing me tonight.)
      No hard feelings, just a little more peace,
      Learning to embrace the girl I used to be—
      Yeah, I’m choosing me tonight.
      I’m choosing me.</p>
  
      <p>[Outro]
      We’re moving on, and maybe that’s alright,
      Two honest hearts stepping into new light.
      No hard feelings, just a quiet release—
      And we’re both finding our own kind of peace.</p>

      <p><strong>Official audio for "Lost in Silence" by Horizon Sound.</strong></p>
  
      <p>“Lost in Silence” is a warm, modern acoustic‑pop duet built on bright guitar, soft indie‑pop percussion, and a smooth, uplifting groove. The track blends expressive female vocals with a gentle male counterpoint, layered over subtle electric guitar textures and a polished, radio‑ready mix. Emotional yet hopeful, it captures the quiet ache of two people drifting apart while still wishing each other peace.</p>
  
      <p>The song follows a couple facing the truth that love has faded, even though the care remains. Through shared verses and mirrored perspectives, they navigate distance, unspoken hurt, and the painful honesty of letting go. Their final chorus becomes a mutual release — not out of anger, but acceptance — as they step into new light with gratitude and clarity.</p>

      <p>[Intro]
      We try so hard, but sometimes love just fades,
      Two honest hearts walking different ways.
      No hard feelings, just a quiet truth—
      Lost in silence, trying to find our way through.</p>
  
      <p>[Verse 1]
      I’m sitting right beside you,
      but you feel so far away.
      Your eyes are somewhere distant,
      like you’re fading more each day.
      We used to talk forever,
      about all our plans and dreams.
      Now we barely talk at all,
      and neither one of us feels seen.</p>
  
      <p>[Pre Chorus]
      I see the way you’re hurting.
      Even when you look away.
      I want to reach out and hold you,
      but I just don’t know what to say.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]
      Never heard silence quite so loud.
      Both wanting change,
      Both needing more,
      Both feeling something we can’t ignore.
      Never heard silence quite so loud.
      Both losing ground,
      Both breaking down,
      Neither wants to be the first to say— goodbye.</p>
  
      <p>[Verse 2]
      I can see you pulling away,
      and I’m not proud of who I’ve been.
      I want to reach out and hold you,
      but I know it’d break me again.
      I miss the nights we’d talk for hours,
      like nothing could pull us apart.
      Now when I try to reach you,
      I can’t find my way to your heart.</p>
  
      <p>[Pre Chorus]
      I’m trying not to blame you,
      for the words you never said,
      but the absence in your eyes,
      says you’re letting go instead.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]
      Never heard silence quite so loud.
      Both wanting change,
      Both needing more,
      Both feeling something we can’t ignore.
      Never heard silence quite so loud.
      Both losing ground,
      Both breaking for the last time,
      So we finally say— goodbye.</p>
      
      <p>[Outro]
      We’re moving on, and maybe that’s alright,
      Two honest hearts stepping into new light.
      No hard feelings, just a quiet release—
      And we’re both finding our own kind of peace.</p>

    lyrics_html: |
      <p>[Verse]
      You say the world is a place to explore,
      You get a thrill from the race and the roar.
      Then you’re in it,
      We’re so in it…
      Then suddenly you leave—
      A summer you swore you’d never forget,
      When fall comes around, you don’t feel it yet.
      How do I take that?
      I’m so displaced now,
      When you leave me.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]
      You know
      I can't see all around the world
      Can't see all around the world without you
      (All around the world)
      Can't see all around the world
      You know
      I can't see all around the world
      Can't see all around the world without you
      (All around the world)
      Can't see all around the world</p>
  
      <p>[Verse]
      I have a routine when I put on my face,
      Try to cover it up so I don’t look the same.
      Then it’s foundation,
      Eyes,
      Lips…
      Then I’m brand new.
      But you show up saying, “Hey,
      I’ve got someone in mind for you today —
      The one you think of
      All of the time,
      Who would take you out,
      Who would treat you right…
      The way he should.”</p>
  
      <p>[Bridge]
      Maybe I was chasing you too far,
      Running circles ’round your shooting star.
      But every place you showed me how to see
      Is still a map that leads me back to me.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]
      You know
      I can see all around the world,
      But it’s different than it was with you.
      (All around the world)
      I’m learning what is true.
      You know
      I can see all around the world,
      Even if I miss the view I knew.
      (All around the world)
      I’m finding something new.</p>
  
      <p>[Outro]
      All around the world…
      I’m still moving.
      All around the world…
      I’m still choosing.
      All around the world…
      I’m finding me.</p>

    <p><strong>Official audio for “After the Silence” by Horizon Sound.</strong></p>

    <p>“After the Silence” is a calm, reflective emotional pop ballad shaped by warm expressive female vocals, soft piano, warm strings, airy pads, and gentle drums. It carries the quiet strength that follows a long storm — the moment when the noise fades, the dust settles, and healing finally has room to breathe.</p>

    <p>The song follows a woman standing in the stillness left behind after heartbreak. She traces the cracks, acknowledges the wreckage, and slowly discovers a softer, steadier version of herself emerging in the quiet. “After the Silence” captures the slow rise of hope, the courage to trust again, and the quiet power of rebuilding from the inside out.</p>

  lyrics_html: |
    <p>[Verse 1]<br>
    The storm has finally faded,<br>
    Left a quiet in its wake.<br>
    All the words we left unspoken<br>
    Start to rise and resonate.<br>
    Now I’m standing in the stillness<br>
    Where the wreckage used to be —<br>
    And in the space you left behind,<br>
    I feel a softer part of me.</p>

    <p>[Pre‑Chorus]<br>
    I’ve been learning how to breathe again<br>
    In a world that doesn’t feel the same.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]<br>
    After the silence…<br>
    I can hear my heartbeat steady for the first time in a while.<br>
    There’s a softness in the quiet that I never thought I’d find again.<br>
    After the silence…<br>
    I’m not who I was before I fell,<br>
    But I’m stronger than the pieces of it all.<br>
    And I’m finally finding light again…<br>
    After the silence.</p>

    <p>[Verse 2]<br>
    I trace the cracks along the walls —<br>
    Every fracture tells the truth.<br>
    I was trying to hold my world together<br>
    Even though I was breaking inside.<br>
    But now the calm is settling<br>
    Like a blanket on my skin —<br>
    And in the quiet of this moment,<br>
    I feel something new begin.</p>

    <p>[Pre‑Chorus]<br>
    I’m still learning how to trust myself,<br>
    But I’m standing on my own.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]<br>
    After the silence…<br>
    I can hear my heartbeat steady for the first time in a while.<br>
    There’s a softness in the quiet that I never thought I’d find again.<br>
    After the silence…<br>
    I’m not who I was before I fell,<br>
    But I’m stronger than the pieces of it all.<br>
    And I’m finally finding light again…<br>
    After the silence.</p>

    <p>[Bridge]<br>
    Maybe healing isn’t sudden,<br>
    Maybe peace is slow to rise.<br>
    Maybe strength is just the courage<br>
    To sit with what survived.<br>
    But in the hush that fills this room,<br>
    In the calm that meets my eyes —<br>
    I feel the world returning<br>
    One small breath at a time.</p>

    <p>[Final Chorus]<br>
    After the silence…<br>
    I can hear my own voice calling from a place I thought was gone.<br>
    There’s a warmth inside the quiet where the hurt can’t linger on.<br>
    I’m not who I was before I fell,<br>
    But I’m learning I don’t need to be.<br>
    And I’m finally stepping into light again…<br>
    After the silence.</p>

    <p>[Outro]<br>
    The quiet feels unfamiliar…<br>
    But it’s starting to feel like mine.</p>

  lyrics_html: |
    <p>[Intro]<br>
    One light left on the stage…<br>
    Still shining where you used to stand</p>

    <p>[Verse 1]<br>
    I walk across these worn‑out floorboards,<br>
    Feel the echo of your soul.<br>
    Every word you ever whispered<br>
    Still hangs heavy in the cold.<br>
    I keep the bulb burning softly —<br>
    It’s a promise I can’t shake.<br>
    A little glow for all the moments<br>
    That the darkness couldn’t take.</p>

    <p>[Pre‑Chorus]<br>
    My mind knows you’re gone, but<br>
    My heart still feels you waiting in the wings.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]<br>
    You’re my ghostlight —<br>
    The little flame I leave on when the world slips into night.<br>
    A quiet glow that illuminates the space<br>
    Where your memory still fills the place.<br>
    I know you won’t be walking in,<br>
    But I can’t let the darkness win.<br>
    So I keep it burning bright…<br>
    My ghostlight.</p>

    <p>[Verse 2]<br>
    I’ve tried to close the curtains slowly,<br>
    Tried to sweep this stage of you.<br>
    But the dust keeps rising softly,<br>
    Tracing all we couldn’t do.<br>
    And though the seats are cold and empty,<br>
    I replay the lines we wrote —<br>
    Every laugh and every heartbreak<br>
    Still rehearsed in every note.</p>

    <p>[Pre‑Chorus]<br>
    I know the show is over,<br>
    But I can’t dim what still remains.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]<br>
    You’re my ghostlight —<br>
    The little flame I leave on when the world slips into night.<br>
    A quiet glow that illuminates the space<br>
    Where your memory still fills this place.<br>
    I know you won’t be walking in,<br>
    But I can’t let the darkness win.<br>
    So I keep it burning bright…<br>
    My ghostlight.</p>

    <p>[Bridge]<br>
    Maybe someday I’ll switch it off<br>
    And let the shadows have their turn.<br>
    Maybe someday I’ll walk away<br>
    From all the things that still burn.<br>
    But tonight I need the comfort<br>
    Of the glow you left behind —<br>
    A single light to guide me<br>
    Through all the corners of my mind.</p>

    <p>[Final Chorus]<br>
    You’re my ghostlight —<br>
    Still shining brightly while I’m learning to be alright.<br>
    A quiet flame that anchors this place<br>
    Where I loved you more than time or space.<br>
    I can feel you won’t be back again,<br>
    But letting go takes strength I still don’t have<br>
    So I’ll keep it burning bright…<br>
    My ghostlight.</p>

    <p>[Outro]<br>
    One light left on the stage…<br>
    Waiting for the day I’m ready to let go.</p>

    <p>“If You’d Asked” is a slow, aching emotional pop ballad shaped by warm expressive female vocals, soft piano, warm strings, subtle drums, and spacious reverb. It carries the weight of regret — the heartbreak of a love that ended not with a fight, but with silence.</p>

    <p>The song tells the story of someone who would have stayed, fought, rebuilt, and tried again… if only the other person had asked. She had answers ready for questions that never came, hope ready for a chance that never arrived. Instead, the door closed quietly, leaving her with all the words she never got to say. “If You’d Asked” captures the pain of unspoken love and the ache of a goodbye that didn’t have to happen.</p>

  lyrics_html: |
    <p>[Intro]<br>
    I keep replaying the moment<br>
    When you let go without a word</p>

    <p>[Verse 1]<br>
    You said you didn’t want to hurt me,<br>
    So you walked away instead.<br>
    You left the questions on the table,<br>
    And the words you left unsaid.<br>
    I was waiting for a reason,<br>
    For a sign you’d change your mind —<br>
    But you never turned around,<br>
    Never gave us one more try.</p>

    <p>[Pre‑Chorus]<br>
    And I wonder if you ever knew<br>
    How close I was to choosing you.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]<br>
    If you’d asked…<br>
    I would’ve stayed,<br>
    I would’ve fought, I would’ve held you through the fall.<br>
    If you’d asked…<br>
    I would’ve tried to change, tried to bring the fire back.<br>
    But you never said a word,<br>
    Never let me heal the hurt.<br>
    You just left me in the past…<br>
    If only you’d asked.</p>

    <p>[Verse 2]<br>
    I rehearsed all the answers<br>
    To the questions you never asked.<br>
    I was ready for the hard work,<br>
    To rebuild what we had.<br>
    But you made the choice in silence,<br>
    Closed the door without a sound —<br>
    And the stillness in that moment<br>
    Told me you were truly gone.</p>

    <p>[Pre‑Chorus]<br>
    And I wonder if you ever knew<br>
    How close I was to choosing you.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]<br>
    If you’d asked…<br>
    I would’ve stayed,<br>
    I would’ve fought, I would’ve held you through the fall.<br>
    If you’d asked…<br>
    I would’ve tried to change, tried to bring the fire back.<br>
    But you never said a word,<br>
    Never let me heal the hurt.<br>
    You just left me in the past…<br>
    If only you’d asked.</p>

    <p>[Bridge]<br>
    Maybe you were afraid to need me,<br>
    Maybe your pride got in the way.<br>
    Maybe loving me was too much,<br>
    More than you could ever say.<br>
    But I would’ve carried it all,<br>
    If you’d only let me try —<br>
    You’ll never know a time<br>
    Where we didn’t say goodbye.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]<br>
    If you’d asked…<br>
    I would’ve stayed, I would’ve fought, I would’ve held you through the cracks.<br>
    If you’d asked…<br>
    I would’ve changed the things you needed, tried to bring the fire back.<br>
    But you never said a word,<br>
    Never let me heal the hurt.<br>
    Now I’m learning to let go at last…<br>
    Of what we lost<br>
    When you never asked.</p>

    <p>[Outro]<br>
    You never asked…<br>
    So I walked away…</p>

    <p><strong>Official audio for “Half of Me” by Horizon Sound.</strong></p>

    <p>“Half of Me” is an empowering emotional pop ballad built on warm expressive female vocals, bold piano, rising strings, steady drums, and a cinematic lift that grows stronger with every chorus. It’s a self‑reclaiming anthem — the moment someone stops shrinking themselves to fit inside someone else’s expectations.</p>

    <p>The song follows a woman who softened her edges, quieted her voice, and reshaped herself to keep a love that never saw her fully. She bent until she broke, losing the person she used to be. But as she rebuilds, she discovers the fire she buried deep inside — the part of her that refuses to stay small. “Half of Me” is the sound of taking back space, rediscovering strength, and choosing authenticity over approval.</p>

  lyrics_html: |
    <p>[Intro]<br>
    I sacrificed my edges<br>
    Just to fit inside your lines</p>

    <p>[Verse 1]<br>
    I molded myself to you,<br>
    Softened every part you touched.<br>
    Tried to be the calm you needed,<br>
    Even when it hurt too much.<br>
    I forgot the sound of laughter,<br>
    Lost the person I used to be —<br>
    Till the mirror showed a stranger<br>
    Who was tired of holding on.</p>

    <p>[Pre‑Chorus]<br>
    But something in me is waking,<br>
    The version I long to be.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]<br>
    You only ever loved half of me —<br>
    The part that bent so you could breathe.<br>
    But now I’m finding in me what you couldn’t see,<br>
    The fire I buried deep inside.<br>
    I’m taking back the space I need,<br>
    No longer shrinking just to make you feel strong.<br>
    I’m done being who you wanted me to be…<br>
    You only loved half of me.</p>

    <p>[Verse 2]<br>
    I used to fear the quiet moments,<br>
    It’s when I replayed all my hurt.<br>
    But now I see my own reflection,<br>
    Feel the beating of my heart.<br>
    I’m rebuilding all the pieces<br>
    That crumbled when I tried to stay —<br>
    And the woman I’m becoming<br>
    Would be the first to walk away.</p>

    <p>[Pre‑Chorus]<br>
    My power’s coming from breaking,<br>
    From choosing who I am at last.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]<br>
    You only ever loved half of me —<br>
    The part that bent so you could breathe.<br>
    But now I’m finding in me what you couldn’t see,<br>
    The fire I buried deep inside.<br>
    I’m taking back the space I need,<br>
    No longer shrinking just to make you feel strong.<br>
    I’m done being who you wanted me to be…<br>
    You only loved half of me.</p>

    <p>[Bridge]<br>
    So I’m done apologizing<br>
    For the parts you couldn’t see.<br>
    I’m done with being quiet<br>
    Just to fit inside your lines.<br>
    I’m rising slow and steady<br>
    Into who I’m meant to be —</p>

    <p>[Final Chorus]<br>
    You only ever loved half of me —<br>
    But now I’m embracing all the things<br>
    you never let me be.<br>
    Now I’m shining fearlessly,<br>
    A brighter, bolder melody.<br>
    I’m taking back the space I need,<br>
    No longer shrinking just to make you feel strong.<br>
    I’m finally who I’m meant to be…<br>
    And you can’t have half of me.</p>

    <p>[Outro]<br>
    I’m whole again…<br>
    And I will never turn back.</p>

    <p><strong>Official audio for “Paper Walls” by Horizon Sound.</strong></p>

    <p>“Paper Walls” is a vulnerable emotional pop ballad built around warm expressive female vocals, soft piano, warm strings, airy pads, and a gentle cinematic rise. The song begins in fragile whispers and slowly expands into a soaring, cathartic chorus — the sound of someone finally admitting how breakable they’ve always been beneath the armor.</p>

    <p>The story follows a woman who tried to hide her fears, doubts, and softness behind carefully constructed walls. She painted strength over every crack, hoping no one would see how easily she could fall apart. But one touch, one word, one moment of real connection was enough to reveal the truth she’d been trying to bury. “Paper Walls” captures the moment she realizes that vulnerability isn’t weakness — it’s the beginning of being truly seen.</p>

    <p>🎧 <strong>Vibe:</strong> vulnerable, intimate, cinematic<br>
    🎤 <strong>Vocals:</strong> warm female lead, smooth vibrato, emotional phrasing<br>
    🎛️ <strong>Production:</strong> soft piano, warm strings, airy pads, light drums<br>
    ⚡ <strong>Mood:</strong> fragile‑to‑soaring, honest, cathartic</p>

  lyrics_html: |
    <p>[Intro]<br>
    I built them up so carefully…<br>
    But they never stood a chance</p>

    <p>[Verse 1]<br>
    I filled every crack with hope,<br>
    Painted strength on every side.<br>
    Told the world I didn’t need you,<br>
    Held my breath and hoped they’d see<br>
    All the armor I’d imagined,<br>
    All the lies I tried to sell —<br>
    But the truth was in the trembling<br>
    Every time you met my eyes.</p>

    <p>[Pre‑Chorus]<br>
    One word and I was breaking,<br>
    One touch and I came undone.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]<br>
    ’Cause these paper walls<br>
    Look strong until you lean on them at all.<br>
    One breath, and they fall apart,<br>
    Scattering the pieces of my guarded heart.<br>
    I tried so hard to stand up tall,<br>
    But I was never built to bear that weight.<br>
    You saw right through it all…<br>
    My paper walls.</p>

    <p>[Verse 2]<br>
    I tucked away each fear so neatly,<br>
    Stacked them where you couldn’t see.<br>
    Thought if I could hide the fragile,<br>
    You might stay a while with me.<br>
    But the rain kept seeping in,<br>
    Through the layers of my doubt —<br>
    And the moment that you touched me,<br>
    All the truth came pouring out.</p>

    <p>[Pre‑Chorus]<br>
    One look and I was shaking,<br>
    One sigh and I came undone.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]<br>
    ’Cause these paper walls<br>
    Look strong until you lean on them at all.<br>
    One breath, and they fall apart,<br>
    Scattering the pieces of my guarded heart.<br>
    I tried so hard to stand up tall,<br>
    But I was never built to bear that weight.<br>
    You saw right through it all…<br>
    My paper walls.</p>

    <p>[Bridge]<br>
    Maybe I was scared to show<br>
    The softness deep inside.<br>
    Maybe I believed that love<br>
    Was something I’d be denied.<br>
    But you held the broken pieces<br>
    Like they mattered after all —<br>
    And I learned that even when I’m fragile<br>
    I can stand when you’re by my side.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]<br>
    These paper walls<br>
    Aren’t meant to keep out every rise and fall.<br>
    I’m learning not to fear the cracks,<br>
    Let the light shine through the places I’ve held back.<br>
    I don’t need to stand up tall —<br>
    Not when I have someone<br>
    to lean on through it all.<br>
    You helped me see beyond<br>
    My paper walls.</p>

    <p>[Outro]<br>
    I’m stronger now…<br>
    Because I let them fall.</p>

    <p><strong>Official audio for “The Way We Lied” by Horizon Sound.</strong></p>

    <p>“The Way We Lied” is a slow, aching emotional pop ballad shaped by warm expressive female vocals, soft piano, warm strings, and spacious reverb. It captures the heavy truth of a love that faded long before either person was willing to admit it — a relationship held together by hope, denial, and silence.</p>

    <p>The song follows two people pretending they’re still okay, painting over cracks, brushing aside tears, and calling heartbreak “just a bruise.” The real truth sits in the quiet moments — the distance at the table, the promises neither of them believes anymore. It’s a confession of the ways we cling to something already slipping away, and the pain of finally facing what’s been true all along.</p>

    <p>🎧 <strong>Vibe:</strong> slow, heavy, emotional<br>
    🎤 <strong>Vocals:</strong> warm female lead, rich tone, intimate delivery<br>
    🎛️ <strong>Production:</strong> soft piano, warm strings, light drums, atmospheric reverb<br>
    ⚡ <strong>Mood:</strong> aching, reflective, quietly devastating</p>

  lyrics_html: |
    <p>[INTRO]<br>
    We said we were alright…<br>
    Even when the truth was breaking</p>

    <p>[VERSE 1]<br>
    We told ourselves the fire lingered,<br>
    Even when the embers died.<br>
    We held hands like perfect strangers<br>
    Trying hard to justify<br>
    Every silence at the table,<br>
    Every tear we brushed aside —<br>
    Calling distance “just a rough patch,”<br>
    Calling heartbreak “just a bruise.”</p>

    <p>[PRE‑CHORUS]<br>
    But the truth was in the silence,<br>
    In the things we didn’t say.</p>

    <p>[CHORUS]<br>
    That’s the way we lied —<br>
    Saying anything to keep a fading love alive.<br>
    Convincing ourselves that we were fine,<br>
    When we both knew we were running out of time.<br>
    We painted over every crack,<br>
    Pretending we could find our way back.<br>
    But we were breaking from inside…<br>
    That’s the way we lied.</p>

    <p>[VERSE 2]<br>
    We told ourselves we’d fix it later,<br>
    But later never came.<br>
    We held on to fading moments,<br>
    Watching as each one slipped away.<br>
    You said you’d try harder,<br>
    I said I’d learn to bend —<br>
    But we both knew we’d stopped believing<br>
    Long before we reached this end.</p>

    <p>[PRE‑CHORUS]<br>
    And the truth kept getting louder<br>
    Slowly drowning out the lies.</p>

    <p>[CHORUS]<br>
    That’s the way we lied —<br>
    Saying anything to keep a fading love alive.<br>
    Convincing ourselves that we were fine,<br>
    When we both knew we were running out of time.<br>
    We painted over every crack,<br>
    Pretending we could find our way back.<br>
    But we were breaking from inside…<br>
    That’s the way we lied.</p>

    <p>[BRIDGE]<br>
    Maybe we were scared to see<br>
    The life we built was gone.<br>
    Maybe loving you meant staying<br>
    Long after our hearts moved on.<br>
    And maybe truth cut far too deep<br>
    For hearts already worn.</p>

    <p>[CHORUS]<br>
    That’s the way we lied —<br>
    Saying anything to keep a fading love alive.<br>
    Convincing ourselves that we were fine,<br>
    When we both knew we were running out of time.<br>
    We painted over every crack,<br>
    Pretending we could find our way back.<br>
    But we were breaking from inside…<br>
    That’s the way we lied.</p>

    <p><strong>Official audio for “Homesick for You” by Horizon Sound.</strong></p>

    <p>“Homesick for You” is a soft, reflective emotional pop ballad built around gentle piano, warm pads, subtle strings, and a spacious, nostalgic atmosphere. The warm expressive female vocal brings a tender ache to the story — not longing for a lost love, but longing for the version of herself she became when she felt safe.</p>

    <p>The song explores the quiet grief of losing the person you were in a relationship that once felt like home. She isn’t missing the romance or the heartbreak — she’s missing the softness, the bravery, the lightness she carried back then. It’s a search for the self she left behind, and a hope that she can find her way back to that version of herself again.</p>

  lyrics_html: |
    <p>[INTRO]<br>
    I miss a place I can’t return to…<br>
    A version of myself I was with you.</p>

    <p>[VERSE 1]<br>
    There was a light inside my laughter,<br>
    A softness in the way I breathed.<br>
    You held the parts I hid from others,<br>
    Made the broken feel complete.<br>
    Now I’m going through my memories,<br>
    Trying hard to find that girl —<br>
    But she’s somewhere in the distance,<br>
    In a long‑forgotten world.</p>

    <p>[PRE‑CHORUS]<br>
    I don’t miss the way we ended…<br>
    I miss who I was back then.</p>

    <p>[CHORUS]<br>
    I’m homesick for you —<br>
    Not the love, not the hurt, but the me I used to be.<br>
    Homesick for the way<br>
    I felt safe enough to let my armor fall.<br>
    I’m not longing for your arms,<br>
    Just the calm before the storms.<br>
    I’m missing who I grew into…<br>
    I’m homesick for you.</p>

    <p>[VERSE 2]<br>
    I try to find her in the mirror,<br>
    But her smile doesn’t look like mine.<br>
    She was softer, she was braver,<br>
    She believed in brighter times.<br>
    Now I’m trying hard to reach her,<br>
    Trying to bring her back again —<br>
    But it’s hard to find the pieces<br>
    When you don’t know where they went.</p>

    <p>[PRE‑CHORUS]<br>
    I don’t need the past to save me…<br>
    I just want to recognize myself again.</p>

    <p>[CHORUS]<br>
    I’m homesick for you —<br>
    Not the love, not the hurt, but the me I used to be.<br>

    I felt safe enough to let my armor fall.<br>
    I’m not longing for your arms,<br>
    Just the calm before the storms.<br>
    I’m missing who I grew into…<br>
    I’m homesick for you.</p>

    <p>[BRIDGE]<br>
    Maybe I’ve always been her,<br>
    Just shining in the light you gave.<br>
    Maybe I can bring her back<br>
    Without retracing every ache.<br>
    Maybe healing isn’t finding you —<br>
    It’s finding me again<br>
    In all the places I hid.</p>

    <p>[CHORUS]<br>
    I’m homesick for you —<br>
    Not the love, not the hurt, but the me I used to be.<br>

    <p><strong>Official audio for “Borrowed Time” by Horizon Sound.</strong></p>

    <p>“Borrowed Time” is a tender, mid‑tempo emotional pop ballad shaped by warm expressive female vocals, soft piano, gentle strings, and a nostalgic cinematic glow. It carries a bittersweet rise, balancing tenderness with the ache of knowing something beautiful was never meant to last.</p>

    <p>The song tells the story of loving someone you always knew you couldn’t keep. Every moment felt temporary, every kiss a small miracle borrowed from a future where the ending was already written. She holds on anyway — choosing fleeting warmth over emptiness — even as she feels the distance growing. It’s a confession of loving in the shadows of inevitability, and cherishing the seconds that were never really hers.</p>

  lyrics_html: |
    <p>[INTRO]<br>
    I always knew the clock was ticking,<br>
    But I held on to the moment anyway.</p>

    <p>[VERSE 1]<br>
    You were sunlight in the winter,<br>
    Warmth I never thought I’d feel.<br>
    Every touch was temporary,<br>
    But it all felt so unreal.<br>
    I could see the ending coming,<br>
    Like a shadow on the floor —<br>
    Still I held you like a secret<br>
    I’d be foolish to ignore.</p>

    <p>[PRE‑CHORUS]<br>
    I knew the ending waited,<br>
    Somewhere just beyond your smile.</p>

    <p>[CHORUS]<br>
    We were living on borrowed time —<br>
    Holding on to seconds that were never really mine.<br>
    Every kiss, every night,<br>
    Was a moment I kept stealing from the light.<br>
    I knew someday you’d draw the line,<br>
    But I stayed anyway, pretending you were mine.<br>
    Love that wasn’t built to last…<br>
    Still felt worth the borrowed time.</p>

    <p>[VERSE 2]<br>
    You were always half a promise,<br>
    Half a dream I couldn’t keep.<br>
    But I chose the fleeting magic<br>
    Over nights of dreamless sleep.<br>
    I could feel you drifting slowly,<br>
    Like a tide that won’t return —<br>
    But I held on to the embers<br>
    Just to feel a little burn.</p>

    <p>[PRE‑CHORUS]<br>
    I knew the ending was coming,<br>
    But I held on to what we had.</p>

    <p>[CHORUS]<br>
    We were living on borrowed time —<br>
    Holding on to seconds that were never really mine.<br>
    Every kiss, every night,<br>
    Was a moment I kept stealing from the light.<br>
    I knew someday you’d draw the line,<br>
    But I stayed anyway, pretending you were mine.<br>
    Love that wasn’t built to last…<br>
    Still felt worth the borrowed time.</p>

    <p>[BRIDGE]<br>
    Maybe loving you was choosing<br>
    Beauty over what was true.<br>
    Maybe I was meant to lose you<br>
    Just to learn what love can do.<br>
    And though the ending still reminds me<br>
    How the sweetest things can fade —<br>
    I don’t regret a single heartbeat<br>
    Of the moments that we made.</p>

    <p>[CHORUS]<br>
    We were living on borrowed time —<br>
    And I’d do it all again just to feel your hand in mine.<br>
    Every kiss, every night,<br>
    Was a spark that made the darkness feel like light.<br>
    I knew someday you’d draw the line,<br>
    But I stayed anyway, pretending you were mine.<br>
    Some loves only last a while…<br>
    But they’re worth the borrowed time.</p>

    <p>[OUTRO]<br>
    I always knew the clock was ticking…<br>

    <p><strong>Official audio for “The Quiet After” by Horizon Sound.</strong></p>

    <p>“The Quiet After” is a slow, cinematic pop‑soul ballad built around warm expressive female vocals, intimate close‑mic delivery, and a soft, resonant piano at the center. Gentle strings, subtle drums, and spacious reverb create a heartbreak‑after‑the‑storm atmosphere — the kind of quiet that feels heavier than the chaos that came before it.</p>

    <p>The song follows someone standing in the aftermath of a love that’s finally burned out. The shouting is gone, the fire has faded, and what remains is the painful clarity of silence. She walks through rooms still holding traces of what used to be — a coat by the door, a cup on the counter — realizing that the quiet things now feel louder than the love they lost. As she picks up the pieces, she begins the slow process of learning how to live again.</p>

  lyrics_html: |
    <p>[INTRO]<br>
    I still hear the whisper of your voice.<br>
    But the quiet’s closing in on me.</p>

    <p>[VERSE 1]<br>
    We used to fill these rooms with passion<br>
    Every touch a spark that roared.<br>
    Now I’m walking through the silence<br>
    Where love won’t burn like once before.<br>
    There’s a cup still on the counter<br>
    Your coat hanging by the door.<br>
    Funny how the quiet things<br>
    Feel louder than before.</p>

    <p>[PRE‑CHORUS]<br>
    I thought the storm would break me<br>
    But it’s the calm that hurts the most.</p>

    <p>[CHORUS]<br>
    This is the quiet after —<br>
    When the shouting fades and the truth rings louder.<br>
    When the tears run dry and the nights grow colder,<br>
    And the weight of what we were<br>
    Falls heavy on our shoulders.<br>
    No more fire, no more passion…<br>
    Just me, picking up the pieces<br>
    In the quiet after.</p>

    <p>[VERSE 2]<br>
    I keep reliving every moment<br>
    Trying to see what I ignored.<br>
    All the warnings in your actions<br>
    All the distance you explored.<br>
    Now the silence feels like prison<br>
    A sentence I can’t appeal.<br>
    I never knew that losing you<br>
    Would be the ache I couldn’t heal.</p>

    <p>[PRE‑CHORUS]<br>
    I thought our love would save us,<br>
    But nothing could have braced me for the pain.</p>

    <p>[CHORUS]<br>
    This is the quiet after —<br>
    When the shouting fades and the truth rings louder.<br>
    When the tears run dry and the nights grow colder,<br>

    Falls heavy on our shoulders.<br>
    No more fire, no more passion…<br>
    Just me, picking up the pieces<br>
    In the quiet after.</p>

    <p>[BRIDGE]<br>
    Maybe someday I’ll forgive us<br>
    For the words we never said.<br>
    For the love we couldn’t mend,<br>
    For the dreams we left for dead.<br>
    But tonight I’m stuck between us,<br>
    In the space you used to be —<br>
    Trying to breathe inside the silence<br>
    In a pain that keeps its hold on me.</p>

    <p>[CHORUS]<br>
    This is the quiet after —<br>
    When the shouting fades and the truth rings louder.<br>

    The room no longer holds your memory,<br>
    And I’m learning how to stand here on my own.</p>

    <p><strong>Official audio for “Already Out the Door” by Horizon Sound.</strong></p>

    <p>“Already Out the Door” is a modern country heartbreak story built on warm acoustic guitars, steady mid‑tempo drums, and clean Nashville‑style electric fills. An emotional male lead vocal carries the song with sincerity and restraint, avoiding exaggerated twang while leaning into a wounded, reflective tone. Smooth harmonies bloom only in the chorus, adding lift without overshadowing the intimacy of the verses. The production is polished, spacious, and subtly atmospheric, letting the storytelling take center stage.</p>

    <p>This song captures the quiet devastation of realizing trust is gone — the late‑night waiting, the phone location that tells the truth, and the moment a relationship breaks without a single raised voice. Honest, grounded, and deeply human, “Already Out the Door” is a modern country confession for anyone who’s stayed too long, hoped too hard, and finally walked away with nothing left to give.</p>

    <p>🎧 <strong>Vibe:</strong> modern country, mid‑tempo, emotional, reflective<br>
    🎤 <strong>Vocals:</strong> sincere male lead, warm tone, soft harmonies in the chorus<br>
    🎛️ <strong>Production:</strong> acoustic‑driven, subtle electric fills, clean Nashville mix<br>

    <p>[Verse 1]<br>
    You said you were out with the girls,<br>
    but your dot never left his street.<br>
    I waited up hopin’ I was wrong,<br>
    but the map don’t lie…<br>
    the way you lied to me.</p>

    <p>[Pre‑Chorus]<br>
    You’ve said "baby, I swear" so many times,<br>
    you made the truth into somethin’ I don’t recognize.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]<br>
    You say you’re tellin’ the truth,<br>
    but I’ve heard that line before.<br>
    Your phone said you were with him,<br>
    while I sat here waiting by the door.<br>
    Maybe you mean it tonight…<br>
    but I can’t trust you anymore.<br>
    It hurts when the proof shows up<br>
    in all the places you tried to hide.<br>
    Yeah, maybe you’re honest tonight…<br>
    but I’m already out the door.</p>

    <p>[Verse 2]<br>
    I remember when your word meant somethin’,<br>
    back before the cracks started showin’ through.<br>
    Now every promise feels borrowed,<br>
    and every answer sounds rehearsed instead of true.<br>
    You say tonight you’re bein’ honest,<br>
    but I heard that tremble in your voice.<br>
    And even if you’re tellin’ the truth right now,<br>
    I just can’t believe you anymore.</p>

    <p>[Pre‑Chorus]<br>
    I’ve heard every promise you’ve ever made,<br>
    and every one just fades a little more with every word you speak.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]<br>
    You say you’re tellin’ the truth,<br>
    but I’ve heard that line before.<br>
    Your phone said you were with him,<br>
    while I sat here waiting by the door.<br>
    Maybe you mean it tonight…<br>
    but I can’t trust you anymore.<br>
    It hurts when the proof shows up<br>
    in all the places you tried to hide.<br>
    Yeah, maybe you’re honest tonight…<br>
    but I’m already out the door.</p>

    <p>[Verse 3]<br>
    I’m standin’ here lookin’ at you<br>
    and I wish I felt somethin’ break inside.<br>
    But all the hurt already happened<br>
    and all the tears already dried.<br>
    You say tonight you’re tellin’ the truth,<br>
    and maybe for once that’s not wrong.<br>
    But trust don’t heal up overnight,<br>
    and mine’s been gone for far too long.</p>

    <p>[Bridge]<br>
    I shouldn’t have to check a map<br>
    to know where you’ve been.<br>
    If I can’t trust what you say,<br>
    how could we ever make this right?</p>

    <p>[Chorus]<br>
    You say you’re tellin’ the truth,<br>
    but I’ve heard that line before.<br>
    Your phone said you were with him,<br>
    while I sat here waiting by the door.<br>
    Maybe you mean it tonight…<br>
    but I can’t trust you anymore.<br>
    It hurts when the proof shows up<br>
    in all the places you tried to hide.<br>
    Yeah, maybe you’re honest tonight…<br>
    but I’m already out the door.</p>

    <p>[Outro]<br>
    I’m already out the door.<br>
    Yeah, I’m already out the door…</p>

    <p><strong>Official audio for “Saltwater” by Horizon Sound.</strong></p>

    <p>“Saltwater” is a flowing, tidal emotional pop ballad built on warm expressive female vocals, soft piano, warm strings, airy pads, and gentle drums. It rises and falls like waves — a cathartic release of everything held back, everything unsaid, everything too heavy to carry alone.</p>

    <p>The song follows a woman trying to hold back the emotional ocean inside her, only to realize that letting the tears fall is the first step toward healing. Each wave brings memory, ache, and clarity. “Saltwater” captures the cleansing power of release, the beauty in breaking open, and the quiet transformation that comes when you finally stop fighting the tide.</p>

  lyrics_html: |
    <p>[Intro]
    It rises without warning…
    Like a tide I can’t contain</p>

    <p>[Verse 1]
    I feel like I’m holding back the ocean,
    These storms behind my eyes.
    Telling everyone I’m fine,
    While the waves betray the lie.
    Every memory you left me
    Creates currents I can’t fight —
    And the more that I brace myself,
    The faster they arrive.</p>

    <p>[Pre Chorus]
    I try to breathe above it,
    But the truth keeps pulling me under.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]
    Saltwater falls again —
    Sliding down my cheeks like the sea spray in the wind.
    Saltwater, breaking free,
    Every tear a piece of what you meant to me.
    I can’t stop the flood within,
    But maybe letting go is how the healing finally begins.
    So let it rise, let it pour…
    Saltwater once more.</p>

    <p>[Verse 2]
    I’ve been drowning in the silence,
    In the words we never said.
    All the promises we whispered
    Now just echoes in my head.
    But there’s something in the letting go,
    A cleansing of the ache —
    Like the tide that steals the shoreline
    Just to give it back again.</p>

    <p>[Pre Chorus]
    I’m learning not to fight it,
    Let the waves wash over me.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]
    Saltwater falls again —
    Sliding down my cheeks like the sea spray in the wind.
    Saltwater, breaking free,
    Every tear a piece of what you meant to me.
    I can’t stop the flood within,
    But maybe letting go is how the healing finally begins.
    So let it rise, let it pour…
    Saltwater once more.</p>

    <p>[Bridge]
    Maybe I was meant to break
    So I could find the pieces worth saving.
    Maybe all this water’s just
    My way of finally changing.
    And when the tide recedes at last,
    I’ll see what’s left of me —
    A shoreline shaped by everything
    You ever meant to me.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]
    Saltwater falls again —
    But it’s softer now, a whisper where the pain had always been.
    Saltwater, setting free
    Every part of me that’s learning who I’m meant to be.
    I don’t fear the flood within,
    It’s the proof that I can rise from where I’ve been.
    Let it rise, let it pour…
    Saltwater no more.</p>

    <p>[Outro]
    The tide pulls back…
    And I remain.</p>

    <p><strong>Official audio for “Unsent Letters” by Horizon Sound.</strong></p>

    <p>“Unsent Letters” is an intimate, confessional emotional pop ballad built around warm expressive female vocals, soft piano, gentle strings, airy pads, and spacious reverb. It carries the late‑night quiet of someone pouring their heart onto the page — not to be read, but to finally be released.</p>

    <p>The song follows a woman who writes letter after letter to the person she lost, filling pages with the truths she never had the courage to say out loud. Some letters ache with longing, some with regret, and one — written to herself — becomes the first step toward healing. “Unsent Letters” captures the bittersweet ritual of writing to let go, the ache of unspoken words, and the quiet strength found in finally choosing yourself.</p>

    🎤 <strong>Vocals:</strong> warm female lead, smooth vibrato, emotional phrasing<br>
    🎛️ <strong>Production:</strong> soft piano, warm strings, airy pads, subtle drums<br>

    <p>[Intro]
    Another page written,
    But I’m too afraid to send.</p>

    <p>[Verse 1]
    I wrote you in the early hours,
    When the world was fast asleep.
    Told you how I missed your laughter,
    How your silence cut too deep.
    I folded up the letter,
    And sealed it with a kiss —
    Left it in a drawer somewhere,
    Where all my unsent letters sit.</p>

    <p>[Pre Chorus]
    Every word I never told you
    Still finds their way back to me.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]
    These are my unsent letters —
    All the things I couldn’t say when we were together.
    Every truth I tried to hide
    Comes spilling out in ink tonight.
    You’ll never read the words I penned,
    But they haunt me every night.
    I write, I fold, I breathe again…
    My unsent letters.</p>

    <p>[Verse 2]
    I wrote you on a Sunday morning,
    When I could still feel you in my bed.
    Told you how the quiet hurt me,
    How I missed the words you never said.
    I tried to find forgiveness,
    But I just came up dry —
    Guess some scars only linger,
    They never truly heal.</p>

    <p>[Pre Chorus]
    Every line I never sent you
    Still keeps tugging at my soul.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]
    These are my unsent letters —
    All the things I couldn’t say when we were together.
    Every truth I tried to hide
    Comes spilling out in ink tonight.
    You’ll never read the words I penned,
    But they haunt me every night.
    I write, I fold, I breathe again…
    My unsent letters.</p>

    <p>[Bridge]
    I wrote one to me and addressed it,
    Signed it with a trembling hand.
    Told myself to stop the pining,
    Told myself to live again.
    Said, “You don’t need his answers,
    You don’t need what might have been.”
    It’s the only letter I’ve written
    That I might just send.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]
    These are my unsent letters —
    Every lie, every hope I held together.
    All the hurt I have inside,
    Now pours out of me, finally free.
    You’ll never read the words I penned,
    But I’m learning how my story ends.
    I write, I fold, I breathe again…
    My unsent letters.</p>

    <p>[Outro]
    Another page written…
    This one’s meant for me.</p>

    <p><strong>Official audio for “The Dress I Never Wore” by Horizon Sound.</strong></p>

    <p>“The Dress I Never Wore” is a slow, aching emotional pop ballad shaped by warm expressive female vocals, soft piano, warm strings, light drums, and airy pads. It carries the weight of lost futures — the dreams built around someone who walked away, and the quiet strength it takes to reclaim your identity afterward.</p>

    <p>The song follows a woman standing in front of a wedding dress that represents everything she once believed in: vows, forever, a life she planned down to the smallest detail. When the relationship ends, she’s left holding a symbol of a future that never came. “The Dress I Never Wore” captures the heartbreak of letting go, the courage of rediscovery, and the moment she begins to see herself clearly again.</p>

    <p>[Intro]
    It’s hanging in the closet
    My promise made in white</p>

    <p>[Verse 1]
    I’ve tried it on a thousand times,
    Just to see how it would feel.
    I dreamed of walking towards forever,
    Down the aisle to stand with you.
    You said love was made for moments,
    But I planned a whole life long.
    Now I’m left holding a dress
    I may never get the chance to wear.</p>

    <p>[Pre Chorus]
    And every stitch reminds me
    Of the girl I used to be.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]
    This is the dress I never wore —
    All the vows, all the dreams hanging by a thread.
    Every satin‑lined hope I saved
    For a love that wouldn’t last.
    You walked out and closed the door,
    Left me holding a fading dream.
    Now I’m learning who I am
    Without the dress I never wore.</p>

    <p>[Verse 2]
    I pictured names we’d give our children,
    Holidays and quiet nights.
    I built a world around your presence,
    Never saw the warning signs.
    Now the fabric feels brittle,
    Like it’s showing the truth —
    That I loved the life I dreamed of
    More than I ever loved you.</p>

    <p>[Pre Chorus]
    And the mirror shows a woman
    Who survived what she never saw coming.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]
    This is the dress I never wore —
    All the vows, all the dreams hanging by a thread.
    Every satin‑lined hope I saved
    For a love that wouldn’t last.
    You walked out and closed the door,
    Left me holding a fading dream.
    Now I’m learning who I am
    Without the dress I never wore.</p>

    <p>[Bridge]
    One day I’ll take it from the hanger,
    Lay it gently on the bed.
    Say goodbye to all the futures
    I don’t need anymore.
    I’ll keep the strength it gave me,
    But let the rest fall away —</p>

    <p>[Chorus]
    This is the dress I never wore —
    All the vows, all the dreams hanging by a thread.
    Every satin‑lined hope I saved
    For a love that wouldn’t last.
    You walked out and closed the door,
    Left me holding a fading dream.
    Now I’m learning who I am
    Without the dress I never wore.</p>

    <p>[Outro]
    I close the door…
    And walk away.</p>

  lyrics_html: |
    <p>[Intro]
    I’ve been sorting through the ashes
    Of the life I used to know</p>

    <p>[Verse 1]
    I withstood every broken promise,
    Every lie you left behind.
    I stitched myself together slowly,
    Learned that I could be much more.
    There were nights I barely made it,
    Fighting loneliness and regret.
    But the dawn kept pulling at me,
    Not letting me hide inside.</p>

    <p>[Pre Chorus]
    And I finally see the light
    That’s been guiding my way.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]
    I will rise again —
    From the quiet, from the heartbreak, from the weight of what I’ve been.
    I will rise again —
    Stronger than the moment when you watched me fall apart back then.
    Every scar I carry now
    Is a story of the strength I’ve found.
    I’m not who I was back then…
    I rise again.</p>

    <p>[Verse 2]
    I used to fear the empty spaces,
    Too much quiet, too much cold.
    Now I fill them with my power,
    With a fire of my own.
    I’m not looking for forgiveness,
    Not a savior, not a sign.
    I’m the one who kept on breathing
    When there was nothing left inside.</p>

    <p>[Pre Chorus]
    And the voice inside grows louder
    Till it drowns out all my fears.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]
    I will rise again —
    From the quiet, from the heartbreak, from the weight of what I’ve been.
    I will rise again —
    Stronger than the moment when you watched me fall apart back then.
    Every scar I carry now
    Is a story of the strength I’ve found.
    I’m not who I was back when…
    I rise again.</p>

    <p>[Bridge]
    I’m done with shrinking just to stay
    Inside the lines you drew for me.
    I’m stepping out into the light,
    Into the woman I can be.
    And if the past comes calling back,
    I won’t answer, let it fade —
    I’m moving forward, unafraid.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]
    I will rise again —
    From the quiet, from the heartbreak, from the weight of what I’ve been.
    I will rise again —
    Every broken piece becoming something stronger in the end.
    All the scars that marked my skin
    Are reminders of the fight I won.
    This is where my story begins…
    I rise again.</p>

    <p>[Outro]
    I rise again…
    And again…
    And again.</p>

    <p><strong>Official audio for “Back to Amarillo” by Horizon Sound.</strong></p>

    <p>“Back to Amarillo” is a warm, vintage‑inspired 1950s country‑western track built on twangy acoustic guitars, upright bass, and a smooth baritone vocal. The production leans nostalgic and cinematic, capturing the dusty‑trail charm of classic cowboy storytelling. With its gentle swing, melodic lift, and old‑school reverb, the song feels like a lost record from the golden era of western ballads.</p>

    <p>This song follows a drifting cowboy who never stays in one town for long — except Amarillo. There’s a girl there who knows his order, knows his name, and makes the dusty road feel a little less lonely. He’s not ready to settle down, but every time he crosses that county line, he feels the pull of something like home. “Back to Amarillo” is a romantic, heartfelt look at the kind of love that keeps a wanderer coming back.</p>

    <p>🎧 <strong>Vibe:</strong> 1950s western ballad, warm, nostalgic<br>
    🎤 <strong>Vocals:</strong> smooth male baritone, gentle vibrato, classic phrasing<br>

  lyrics_html: |
    <p>[Verse 1]
    I’ve been ridin’ dusty trails,
    chasin’ cattle, chasin’ time.
    Never stay in one town long,
    but there’s one that draws me near,
    ’Cause there’s a girl in Amarillo
    with a smile that pulls me in,
    and every time I cross that county line,
    I fall for her again.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]
    I keep ridin’ back to Amarillo,
    Down that same old dusty trail.
    I ain’t one for settlin’ down,
    but she feels a lot like home.
    And every time I tip my hat
    and see her standin’ in the door,
    I swear my boots get heavier —
    I don’t wanna ride no more.</p>

    <p>[Verse 2]
    She pours coffee at the diner,
    knows my order, knows my name.
    Says I’m always passin’ through here,
    but she’s always glad I came.
    We talk dreams beneath the awning
    while the Texas moon hangs low,
    and though I leave at break of dawn,
    my heart don’t wanna go.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]
    I keep ridin’ back to Amarillo,
    Down that same old dusty trail.
    I ain’t one for settlin’ down,
    but she feels a lot like home.
    And every time I tip my hat
    and see her standin’ in the door,
    I swear my boots get heavier —
    I don’t wanna ride no more.</p>

    <p>[Bridge]
    Maybe someday I’ll stop wanderin’,
    hang my hat beside her bed.
    But for now I’m just a drifter
    With her smile lightin’ up my way.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]
    I keep ridin’ back to Amarillo,
    Down that same old dusty trail.
    I ain’t one for settlin’ down,
    but she feels a lot like home.
    And every time I tip my hat
    and see her standin’ in the door,
    I swear my boots get heavier —
    I don’t wanna ride no more.</p>

  lyrics_html: |
    <p>[Intro]
    If it ain’t broke,
    Then I didn’t try to fix it…</p>

    <p>[Verse 1]
    Woke up this mornin’ feelin’ handy,
    Thought I’d fix the dryer door.
    Grabbed a wrench, a roll of duct tape,
    And a beer from the night before.
    I tightened somethin’ somewhere,
    Heard a pop and let out a sigh…
    Now the whole dang house smells funny —
    But hey, I fixed it mostly right.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]
    Fixed it mostly right before Mama gets home,
    Fixed it mostly right even if it goes wrong.
    If it sparks, smokes, shakes, or ignites,
    Just call it a win if it stays upright.
    It’s wobblin’ a little, but that’s alright —
    Long as I fixed it mostly right.</p>

    <p>[Verse 2]
    Tried patchin’ up the kitchen sink,
    But I made it worse somehow.
    Water shootin’ like a fountain,
    Dog’s swimmin’ ’round the house now.
    Neighbor asked if I need help,
    I said, “Buddy, grab a flashlight!”
    Then the pipe blew through the window —
    But hey, I fixed it mostly right.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]
    Fixed it mostly right before Mama gets home,
    Fixed it mostly right even if it goes wrong.
    If it sparks, smokes, shakes, or ignites,
    Just call it a win if it stays upright.
    It’s wobblin’ a little, but that’s alright —
    Long as I fixed it mostly right.</p>

    <p>[Bridge]
    Sirens blarin’ down the street,
    Neighbor’s laughin’ on the lawn…
    The dog’s swimmin’ out a second‑floor window,
    And Mama’s due home anytime.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]
    Fixed it mostly right before Mama gets home,
    Fixed it mostly right even if it goes wrong.
    If it sparks, smokes, shakes, or ignites,
    Just call it a win if it stays upright.
    It’s wobblin’ a little, but that’s alright —
    Long as I fixed it mostly right.</p>

    <p>[Outro]
    Mama pulled into the driveway,
    Saw the mess that I had caused…
    She said, “What in tarnation…?”
    I said, “Relax… I fixed it mostly right.”</p>

    <p>[Verse 1]
    Summer days, late nights, you and me in paradise,
    Neon glow, warm breeze, dancing barefoot in the sea.
    We were young, we were free, we were living in a dream</p>

    <p>[Pre-Chorus]
    Twelve weeks in Key West, ooh, just you and me</p>

    <p>[Chorus]
    We were burning bright, kissing on the boardwalk,
    Laughing while the waves crashed, taking all our clothes off.
    When the sun dips low, boy, I already know—
    You’ll slip out of my bed, gone before the morning.
    I don’t wanna wake up with my heart broken.
    If our fire dies when the sun sets…
    Baby, don’t you let the summer end.</p>

    <p>[Verse 2]
    Blue eyes, sun‑kissed, couldn’t believe you exist,
    Soft lips, first kiss, nights I never could resist.
    We were young, we were free, living out a perfect dream—</p>

    <p>[Pre-Chorus]
    Twelve weeks in Key West, ooh, just you and me</p>

    <p>[Chorus]
    We were burning bright, kissing on the boardwalk,
    Laughing while the waves crashed, taking all our clothes off.
    When the sun dips low, boy, I already know—
    You’ll slip out of my bed, gone before the morning.
    I don’t wanna wake up with my heart broken.
    If our fire dies when the sun sets…
    Baby, don’t you let the summer end.</p>

    <p>[Bridge]
    Hold me like you mean it,
    Say you’re gonna stay.
    Tell me that this feeling
    Doesn’t fade away.
    Hold me like you mean it,
    Say you’re gonna stay.
    Tell me that this summer
    Doesn’t slip away.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]
    We were burning bright, kissing on the boardwalk,
    Laughing while the waves crashed, taking all our clothes off.
    When the sun dips low, boy, I already know—
    You’ll slip out of my bed, gone before the morning.
    I don’t wanna wake up with my heart broken.
    If our fire dies when the sun sets…
    Baby, don’t you let our summer end.</p>

    <p><strong>Official audio for “Bottle on the Table” by Horizon Sound.</strong></p>

    <p>“Bottle on the Table” is a classic 1950s country‑western ballad steeped in heartbreak, dusty barroom atmosphere, and old‑school storytelling. Recorded in a warm mono style with tube‑mic character, light tape hiss, and a dry room sound, the track captures the raw simplicity of early country. A baritone male vocal leads the way with a weary, lived‑in tone, supported by gentle cowboy‑strum rhythm guitar, mournful steel guitar, upright bass, and a slow western‑swing pulse. The production leans fully into the Hank Williams / Marty Robbins era — no modern polish, just pure vintage emotion.</p>

    <p>This song tells the story of a man left behind by the woman he loved — and betrayed by the friend she rode away with. Alone with a bottle, a jukebox, and the echo of memories he can’t outrun, he tries to drown the hurt in whiskey and worn‑out songs. With its stark imagery, aching delivery, and timeless country sorrow, “Bottle on the Table” feels like a lost classic pulled straight from a 1950s honky‑tonk.</p>

    <p>🎧 <strong>Vibe:</strong> vintage country‑western, slow, dusty, emotional<br>
    🎤 <strong>Vocals:</strong> warm baritone male, classic early‑country delivery<br>
    🎛️ <strong>Production:</strong> mono recording, tube mic warmth, light tape hiss, steel guitar, upright bass, gentle western swing rhythm<br>
    ⚡ <strong>Mood:</strong> heartbroken, reflective, lonely, timeless</p>

    <p>[Verse 1]
    I came home from the rail yard, the daylight nearly gone,
    Found our rings on the table, and the truth hit hard and strong.
    She said she needed someone, said she couldn’t still be mine,
    Then she rode off with my best friend, and left my broken heart behind.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]
    Now there’s a bottle on the table and her shadow on the wall,
    And the jukebox keeps on playin’ my baby’s favorite song.
    She took my heart and left me where the broken‑hearted dwell,
    Now I’m sittin’ here with whiskey tryin’ to drown her memory.
    And the truth keeps sinkin’ deeper every time that bottle falls.</p>

    <p>[Verse 2]
    We used to dance on Fridays when the band would start to play,
    But her eyes lit up and wandered when his shadow crossed the floor.
    I gave her all my wages, every dream I ever planned,
    But she traded love for comfort in another cowboy’s hands.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]
    Now there’s a bottle on the table and her shadow on the wall,
    And the jukebox keeps on playin’ my baby’s favorite song.
    She took my heart and left me where the broken‑hearted dwell,
    Now I’m sittin’ here with whiskey tryin’ to drown her memory.
    And the nights keep gettin’ longer when you’re livin’ with regret.</p>

    <p>[Bridge]
    The night wind keeps on whisperin’ through this shack I call a home,
    And every time it calls her name, it cuts me to the bone.
    I ain’t lookin’ for no mercy, ain’t expectin’ to be saved,
    Just a man with too much memory and a love he couldn’t keep.</p>

    <p>[Final Chorus]
    Now there’s a bottle on the table and her shadow on the wall,
    And the jukebox keeps on playin’ my baby’s favorite song.
    She took my heart and left me where the broken‑hearted dwell,
    Now I’m sittin’ here with whiskey tryin’ to drown her memory.
    And the memories keep on callin’, but I’m learning to let go.</p>

    <p>[Outro]
    So I’ll finish up this whiskey while the jukebox softly plays,
    ’Cause a broken heart keeps hurtin’ long after love has walked away.</p>

    <p>[Verse 1]
    I’ve been wandering through the city with a secret in my smile,
    I let strangers think they know me while I’m guarded deep inside.
    I’ve been dancing with my shadows, learning what my heart still hides,
    And every road I follow somehow leads me back to you.

    You saw past all the glitter, past the laughter and the noise,
    You touched the quiet part of me that rarely finds a voice.
    And suddenly I’m open, like a window in July,
    Letting in the tender warmth that rises when you meet my eyes.</p>

    <p>[Pre‑Chorus]
    I never knew desire could feel so gentle, could feel so right,
    But you hold me like a promise in the middle of the night</p>

    <p>[Chorus]
    Now the boys want me ’cause I’m young and pretty,
    But you’re the one that I have my eyes on.
    And when you whisper what you want from me,
    I’ll take you in, I’ll open willingly.
    I’m reaching out for something real and lasting,
    Hoping you’ll be the one who finally chooses me.</p>

    <p>[Verse 2]
    I’m learning how to breathe again with you here by my side,
    I’m letting all my defenses fall, I’m letting someone in this time.
    You trace the edges of my fears and turn them into light,
    You make the whole world softer now, you make the broken right.

    And every time you touch me, something deeper comes awake,
    A hunger wrapped in tenderness, a sweetness in the ache.
    I never thought I’d find this — something wild, something true,
    But every part of me is singing when I’m lying next to you.</p>

    <p>[Pre‑Chorus]
    I never knew becoming me could feel this easy, feel this free,
    But you show me every moment what it means to really be.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]
    Now the boys want me ’cause I’m young and pretty,
    But you’re the one that I have my eyes on.
    And when you whisper what you want from me,
    I’ll take you in, I’ll open willingly.
    I feel your love unfold in every moment —
    You’re the one who showed me what my heart could be.</p>

    <p>[Bridge]
    Take me where the night is warm and no one else can see,
    Where the world is just your heartbeat and the way you move with me.
    Let the moonlight paint my shoulders, let your hands rewrite my past,
    Let me fall into the future where this feeling always lasts.</p>

    <p>[Pre‑Chorus]
    I’m not afraid of wanting you — I’m only scared of time,
    ’Cause every second that I’m with you feels like something so divine.
    If this is what becoming is, then let me lose control,
    Let me give you every secret, every shadow of my soul.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]
    Now the boys want me ’cause I’m young and pretty,
    But you’re the one that I have my eyes on.
    And when you whisper what you want from me,
    I’ll take you in, I’ll open willingly.
    I’m giving you the love you always sparked in me —
    Every part of who I am is yours completely.</p>

    <p>[Outro]
    (Now the boys want me ’cause I’m young and pretty,
    But you’re the one that I have my eyes on.)
    (Now the world sees me, but you’re the one I’m keeping.)
    (Now the boys want me, but you’re the one I’m choosing.)</p>

    <p>“Barroom Brawl” is a gritty, high‑energy Southern rock track packed with swaggering guitars, driving drums, and cinematic outlaw tension. Blues‑drenched riffs and raw, attitude‑driven vocals give the song its barroom bite, while modern production keeps the chaos crisp and immersive.

    <p>This song tells the story of two people who meet in the heat of a barroom brawl — not as enemies, but as kindred spirits. Amid the chaos, they lock eyes and find something deeper than the noise: a shared defiance, a spark of connection, and the kind of love that doesn’t flinch. With a stomping Southern‑fried chorus and a cinematic bridge, “Barroom Brawl” captures the moment where grit meets grace, and something wild turns into something real.</p>

    <p>[Intro]
    (Spoken, low and cocky)
    I swear I walked in for one damn beer…
    But I always find a way to turn “just one”
    into “Lord, not this again.”

    Guitars hit.
    Drums stomp.
    Barroom lights flicker.</p>

    <p>[Verse 1]
    I ain’t lookin’ for trouble,
    but trouble finds me anyway.
    Soon as I step through the door,
    every head turns my way.
    Bouncer groans, and says,
    “Man, not tonight…”
    One shot turns to three shots,
    and my mouth starts pickin’ fights.</p>

    <p>[Pre Chorus]
    ‘Cause someone heard me talkin’,
    and they didn’t like the sound.
    Stools start slidin’ backward,
    and the room starts gatherin’ ’round.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]
    Met you in the middle of a barroom brawl,
    Dodgin’ fists and breakin’ falls—
    If that ain’t love, hell, I don’t know what is.
    You laughed like hell and said,
    “Boy, you call this flirting?”
    Right there in the smoke and broken glass,
    you stole my breath with that “here we go” grin—
    If that ain’t love in all this mess,
    Hell, I don’t know what is.</p>

    <p>[Verse 2]
    Bouncer tossed us out the door,
    bleedin’ but alive.
    She laughed and said, “You swing wild, boy,
    and damn, you sure take a punch.”
    She pressed ice against her knuckles,
    I wiped blood off my chin—
    Right there on that sidewalk,
    I swear my heart gave in.</p>

    <p>[Pre Chorus]
    ’Cause she’s tougher than the whiskey,
    and sweeter than sin—
    Lord help me, I’m in trouble,
    and I kinda hope I am.</p>

    <p>[Chorus]
    Met you in the middle of a barroom brawl,
    Dodgin’ fists and breakin’ falls—
    If that ain’t love, hell, I don’t know what is.
    You laughed like hell and said,
    “Boy, you call this flirting?”
    Right there in the smoke and broken glass,
    you stole my breath with that “here we go” grin—
    If that ain’t love in all this mess,
    Hell, I don’t know what is.</p>

    <p>[Bridge]
    Darlin’, I been swingin’ wild
    since I was just a child—
    but for you I’ll hang my fists up,
    try to rise above it all.
    No more whiskey‑mouth disasters,
    no more bleedin’ knuckles—
    I’ll be a better man…</p>

    <p>[Chorus]
    Met you in the middle of a barroom brawl,
    Dodgin’ fists and breakin’ falls—
    If that ain’t love, hell, I don’t know what is.
    You laughed like hell and said,
    “Boy, you call this flirting?”
    Right there in the smoke and broken glass,
    you stole my breath with that “here we go” grin—
    If that ain’t love in all this mess,
    Hell, I don’t know what is.</p>

    <p>[Outro]
    I’m swingin’ in another bar,
    another Friday, same old mess.
    Looked around to find my darlin’—
    she weren’t watchin’ me, I guess.
    She was leanin’ on the jukebox,
    smilin’ at some other fool,
    ’cause she didn’t want a changed man—
    she wanted someone—
    still breaking all the rules.</p>
