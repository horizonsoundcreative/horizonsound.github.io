  [Verse 1]
  I was drifting through the days, barely holding on,
  Lost inside the quiet where nights felt way too long.
  Every sunrise felt a lifetime away,
  Till a soft little friend found me one bright day.
  
  [Pre‑Chorus]
  I didn’t know I needed something gentle, something true,
  A reason just to wake up, something warm to pull me through.
  
  [Chorus]
  And Rusty, you were light in the dark,
  A tiny spark that found my heart.
  You gave me something I could hold,
  A little hope when life felt cold.
  You were soft as the dawn,
  A steady place to lean upon.
  You helped me find the girl I’d lost inside —
  You brought me back to life.
  
  [Verse 2]
  Sunlight on the carpet, lighting up your fur,
  Funny how the smallest things make the whole world right. 
  I started laughing more, living in the joy,
  You were small, but you showed me the way.
  
  [Pre‑Chorus]
  You taught me how to slow down, how to feel the world again,
  How healing starts in quiet with a soft and steady friend.
  
  [Chorus]
  And Rusty, you were light in the dark,
  A tiny spark that found my heart.
  You gave me something I could hold,
  A little hope when life felt cold.
  You were soft as the dawn,
  A steady place to lean upon.
  You helped me find the girl I’d lost inside —
  You brought me back to life.
  
  [Bridge]
  Maybe love can look like something small,
  A tiny heartbeat in my arms.
  You showed me I was stronger than I knew,
  And somehow loving you helped me love me too.
  
  [Chorus]
  And Rusty, you were light in the dark,
  A tiny spark that found my heart.
  You gave me something I could hold,
  A little hope when life felt cold.
  You were soft as the dawn,
  A steady place to lean upon.
  You helped me find the girl I’d lost inside —
  You brought me back to life.
