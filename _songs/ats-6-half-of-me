  Official audio for “Half of Me” by Horizon Sound.

  “Half of Me” is an empowering emotional pop ballad built on warm expressive female vocals, bold piano, rising strings, steady drums, and a cinematic lift that grows stronger with every chorus. It’s a self‑reclaiming anthem — the moment someone stops shrinking themselves to fit inside someone else’s expectations.
  
  The song follows a woman who softened her edges, quieted her voice, and reshaped herself to keep a love that never saw her fully. She bent until she broke, losing the person she used to be. But as she rebuilds, she discovers the fire she buried deep inside — the part of her that refuses to stay small. “Half of Me” is the sound of taking back space, rediscovering strength, and choosing authenticity over approval.

  🎤 Vocals: warm female lead, expressive phrasing, powerful lift
  🎛️ Production: piano, warm strings, steady drums, cinematic rise

lyrics: |
  [Intro]
  I sacrificed my edges
  Just to fit inside your lines
  
  [Verse 1]
  I molded myself to you,
  Softened every part you touched.
  Tried to be the calm you needed,
  Even when it hurt too much.
  I forgot the sound of laughter,
  Lost the person I used to be—
  Till the mirror showed a stranger
  Who was tired of holding on.
  
  [Pre Chorus]
  But something in me is waking,
  The version I long to be.
  
  [Chorus]
  You only ever loved half of me —
  The part that bent so you could breathe.
  But now I’m finding in me what you couldn’t see,
  The fire I buried deep inside.
  I’m taking back the space I need,
  No longer shrinking just to make you feel strong.
  I’m done being who you wanted me to be…
  You only loved half of me.
  
  [Verse 2]
  I used to fear the quiet moments,
  It’s when I replayed all my hurt.
  But now I see my own reflection,
  Feel the beating of my heart.
  I’m rebuilding all the pieces
  That crumbled when I tried to stay —
  And the woman I’m becoming
  Would be the first to walk away.
  
  [Pre Chorus]
  My power’s coming from breaking,
  From choosing who I am at last.
  
  [Chorus]
  You only ever loved half of me —
  The part that bent so you could breathe.
  But now I’m finding in me what you couldn’t see,
  The fire I buried deep inside.
  I’m taking back the space I need,
  No longer shrinking just to make you feel strong.
  I’m done being who you wanted me to be…
  You only loved half of me.
  
  [Bridge] 
  So I’m done apologizing
  For the parts you couldn’t see.
  I’m done with being quiet
  Just to fit inside your lines.
  I’m rising slow and steady
  Into who I’m meant to be—
  
  [Final Chorus]
  You only ever loved half of me —
  But now I’m embracing all the things 
  you never let me be.
  Now I’m shining fearlessly,
  A brighter, bolder melody.
  I’m taking back the space I need,
  No longer shrinking just to make you feel strong.
  I’m finally who I’m meant to be…
  And you can’t have half of me.
  
  [Outro]
  I’m whole again…
  And I will never turn back.
