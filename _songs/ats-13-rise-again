lyrics: |
  [Intro]
  I’ve been sorting through the ashes
  Of the life I used to know
  
  [Verse 1]
  I withstood every broken promise,
  Every lie you left behind.
  I stitched myself together slowly,
  Learned that I could be much more.
  There were nights I barely made it,
  Fighting loneliness and regret.
  But the dawn kept pulling at me,
  Not letting me hide inside.
  
  [Pre Chorus]
  And I finally see the light
  That’s been guiding my way.
  
  [Chorus]
  I will rise again —
  From the quiet, from the heartbreak, from the weight of what I’ve been.
  I will rise again —
  Stronger than the moment when you watched me fall apart back then.
  Every scar I carry now
  Is a story of the strength I’ve found.
  I’m not who I was back then…
  I rise again.
  
  [Verse 2]
  I used to fear the empty spaces,
  Too much quiet, too much cold.
  Now I fill them with my power,
  With a fire of my own.
  I’m not looking for forgiveness,
  Not a savior, not a sign.
  I’m the one who kept on breathing
  When there was nothing left inside.
  
  [Pre Chorus]
  And the voice inside grows louder
  Till it drowns out all my fears.
  
  [Chorus]
  I will rise again —
  From the quiet, from the heartbreak, from the weight of what I’ve been.
  I will rise again —
  Stronger than the moment when you watched me fall apart back then.
  Every scar I carry now
  Is a story of the strength I’ve found.
  I’m not who I was back when…
  I rise again.
  
  [Bridge]
  I’m done with shrinking just to stay
  Inside the lines you drew for me.
  I’m stepping out into the light,
  Into the woman I can be.
  And if the past comes calling back,
  I won’t answer, let it fade —
  I’m moving forward, unafraid.
  
  [Chorus]
  I will rise again —
  From the quiet, from the heartbreak, from the weight of what I’ve been.
  I will rise again —
  Every broken piece becoming something stronger in the end.
  All the scars that marked my skin
  Are reminders of the fight I won.
  This is where my story begins…
  I rise again.
  
  [Outro]
  I rise again…
  And again…
  And again.
