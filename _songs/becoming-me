lyrics: |
  [Verse 1]
  I’ve been wandering through the city with a secret in my smile,
  I let strangers think they know me while I’m guarded deep inside.
  I’ve been dancing with my shadows, learning what my heart still hides,
  And every road I follow somehow leads me back to you.
  
  You saw past all the glitter, past the laughter and the noise,
  You touched the quiet part of me that rarely finds a voice.
  And suddenly I’m open, like a window in July,
  Letting in the tender warmth that rises when you meet my eyes. 
  
  [Pre‑Chorus]
  I never knew desire could feel so gentle, could feel so right,
  But you hold me like a promise in the middle of the night
  
  [Chorus]
  Now the boys want me ’cause I’m young and pretty,
  But you’re the one that I have my eyes on.
  And when you whisper what you want from me,
  I’ll take you in, I’ll open willingly.
  I’m reaching out for something real and lasting,
  Hoping you’ll be the one who finally chooses me.
  
  [Verse 2]
  I’m learning how to breathe again with you here by my side,
  I’m letting all my defenses fall, I’m letting someone in this time.
  You trace the edges of my fears and turn them into light,
  You make the whole world softer now, you make the broken right.
  
  And every time you touch me, something deeper comes awake,
  A hunger wrapped in tenderness, a sweetness in the ache.
  I never thought I’d find this — something wild, something true,
  But every part of me is singing when I’m lying next to you.
  
  [Pre‑Chorus]
  I never knew becoming me could feel this easy, feel this free,
  But you show me every moment what it means to really be.
  
  [Chorus]
  Now the boys want me ’cause I’m young and pretty,
  But you’re the one that I have my eyes on.
  And when you whisper what you want from me,
  I’ll take you in, I’ll open willingly.
  I feel your love unfold in every moment —
  You’re the one who showed me what my heart could be.
  
  [Bridge]
  Take me where the night is warm and no one else can see,
  Where the world is just your heartbeat and the way you move with me.
  Let the moonlight paint my shoulders, let your hands rewrite my past,
  Let me fall into the future where this feeling always lasts.
  
  [Pre‑Chorus]
  I’m not afraid of wanting you — I’m only scared of time,
  ’Cause every second that I’m with you feels like something so divine.
  If this is what becoming is, then let me lose control,
  Let me give you every secret, every shadow of my soul.
  
  [Chorus]
  Now the boys want me ’cause I’m young and pretty,
  But you’re the one that I have my eyes on.
  And when you whisper what you want from me,
  I’ll take you in, I’ll open willingly.
  I’m giving you the love you always sparked in me —
  Every part of who I am is yours completely.
  
  [Outro]
  (Now the boys want me ’cause I’m young and pretty,
  But you’re the one that I have my eyes on.)
  (Now the world sees me, but you’re the one I’m keeping.)
  (Now the boys want me, but you’re the one I’m choosing.)
