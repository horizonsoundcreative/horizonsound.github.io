Each wave brings memory, ache, and clarity. “Saltwater” captures the cleansing power of release, the beauty in breaking open, and the quiet transformation that comes when you finally stop fighting the tide.

lyrics: |
  [Intro]
  It rises without warning…
  Like a tide I can’t contain
  
  [Verse 1]
  I feel like I’m holding back the ocean,
  These storms behind my eyes.
  Telling everyone I’m fine,
  While the waves betray the lie.
  Every memory you left me
  Creates currents I can’t fight —
  And the more that I brace myself,
  The faster they arrive.
  
  [Pre Chorus]
  I try to breathe above it,
  But the truth keeps pulling me under.
  
  [Chorus]
  Saltwater falls again —
  Sliding down my cheeks like the sea spray in the wind.
  Saltwater, breaking free,
  Every tear a piece of what you meant to me.
  I can’t stop the flood within,
  But maybe letting go is how the healing finally begins.
  So let it rise, let it pour…
  Saltwater once more.
  
  [Verse 2]
  I’ve been drowning in the silence,
  In the words we never said.
  All the promises we whispered
  Now just echoes in my head.
  But there’s something in the letting go,
  A cleansing of the ache —
  Like the tide that steals the shoreline
  Just to give it back again.
  
  [Pre Chorus]
  I’m learning not to fight it,
  Let the waves wash over me.
  
  [Chorus]
  Saltwater falls again —
  Sliding down my cheeks like the sea spray in the wind.
  Saltwater, breaking free,
  Every tear a piece of what you meant to me.
  I can’t stop the flood within,
  But maybe letting go is how the healing finally begins.
  So let it rise, let it pour…
  Saltwater once more.
  
  [Bridge]
  Maybe I was meant to break
  So I could find the pieces worth saving.
  Maybe all this water’s just
  My way of finally changing.
  And when the tide recedes at last,
  I’ll see what’s left of me —
  A shoreline shaped by everything
  You ever meant to me.
  
  [Chorus]
  Saltwater falls again —
  But it’s softer now, a whisper where the pain had always been.
  Saltwater, setting free
  Every part of me that’s learning who I’m meant to be.
  I don’t fear the flood within,
  It’s the proof that I can rise from where I’ve been.
  Let it rise, let it pour…
  Saltwater no more.
  
  [Outro]
  The tide pulls back…
  And I remain.
