  [Intro]
  Makin' our way to California
  Makin' our way to California
  
  [Verse 1]
  In a rented car we hit the road 
  My big brother sits in the passenger seat
  Dad has one hand on the wheel 
  Laughing at something Chris said
  And I lay my head against the window
  Watching as the world goes by
  And I see the road signs
  
  [Pre-Chorus]
  Illinois, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California
  
  [Chorus]
  We’re riding down old Route 66,
  From Chicago to the coast on a summer trip.
  Stopping at the Wigwam,
  Snapping photos in the desert,
  Where the big meteor hit.
  Yeah, we’re chasing that west‑bound bliss
  ’Til we reach the Santa Monica Pier.
  And I’d do it all again
  Just to feel that time rewind,
  Makin’ our way to California.
  
  [Verse 2]
  Looking for buried treasure,
  Doing nothing, doing something all together.
  Getting sunburned on the side of the road,
  Me and my brother splashing in the Colorado.
  Dad drives us into another small town,
  We’re seeing everything before it’s torn down,
  Reading every road sign.
  
  [Pre-Chorus]
  Illinois, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California
  
  [Bridge]
  I didn’t know then what it meant,
  How fast those summers came and went.
  But every mile we drove back then
  Still feels like going home again.
  
  [Chorus]
  We’re riding down old Route 66,
  From Chicago to the coast on a summer trip.
  Stopping at the Wigwam,
  Snapping photos in the desert,
  Where the big meteor hit.
  Yeah, we’re chasing that west‑bound bliss
  ’Til we reach the Santa Monica Pier.
  And I’d do it all again
  Just to feel that time rewind,
  Makin’ our way to California.
  
  [Intro]
  Makin' our way to California
  Makin' our way to California
