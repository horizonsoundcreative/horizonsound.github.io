  **Official audio for "Lost in Silence" by Horizon Sound.**
  
  “Lost in Silence” is a warm, modern acoustic‑pop duet built on bright guitar, soft indie‑pop percussion, and a smooth, uplifting groove. The track blends expressive female vocals with a gentle male counterpoint, layered over subtle electric guitar textures and a polished, radio‑ready mix. Emotional yet hopeful, it captures the quiet ache of two people drifting apart while still wishing each other peace.
  
  The song follows a couple facing the truth that love has faded, even though the care remains. Through shared verses and mirrored perspectives, they navigate distance, unspoken hurt, and the painful honesty of letting go. Their final chorus becomes a mutual release — not out of anger, but acceptance — as they step into new light with gratitude and clarity.

  **🎧 Vibe:** acoustic‑pop, warm, emotional, reflective  
  **🎤 Vocals:** expressive female lead + soft male duet, airy harmonies  
  **🎛️ Production:** bright acoustic guitar, light indie‑pop percussion, warm bass, clean modern polish

  [Intro]
  We try so hard, but sometimes love just fades,
  Two honest hearts walking different ways.
  No hard feelings, just a quiet truth—
  Lost in silence, trying to find our way through.
  
  [Verse 1]
  I’m sitting right beside you,
  but you feel so far away.
  Your eyes are somewhere distant,
  like you’re fading more each day.
  We used to talk forever, 
  about all our plans and dreams.
  Now we barely talk at all,
  and neither one of us feels seen.
  
  [Pre Chorus]
  I see the way you’re hurting.
  Even when you look away.
  I want to reach out and hold you,
  but I just don’t know what to say.
  
  [Chorus]
  Never heard silence quite so loud.
  Both wanting change,
  Both needing more,
  Both feeling something we can’t ignore.
  Never heard silence quite so loud.
  Both losing ground,
  Both breaking down,
  Neither wants to be the first to say— goodbye.
  
  [Verse 2]
  I can see you pulling away,
  and I’m not proud of who I’ve been.
  I want to reach out and hold you,
  but I know it’d break me again.
  I miss the nights we’d talk for hours,
  like nothing could pull us apart.
  Now when I try to reach you,
  I can’t find my way to your heart.
  
  [Pre Chorus]
  I’m trying not to blame you,
  for the words you never said,
  but the absence in your eyes,
  says you’re letting go instead.
  
  [Chorus]
  Never heard silence quite so loud.
  Both wanting change,
  Both needing more,
  Both feeling something we can’t ignore.
  Never heard silence quite so loud.
  Both losing ground,
  Both breaking down,
  Neither wants to be the first to say— goodbye.
  
  [Bridge]
  We kept hoping it would fix itself,
  but hope can only go so far.
  Letting go is painful,
  but staying hurts us more.
  And the distance between us
  tells us what we must do.
  
  [Chorus]
  Never heard silence quite so loud.
  Both wanting change,
  Both needing more,
  Both feeling something we can’t ignore.
  Never heard silence quite so loud.
  Both losing ground,
  Both breaking for the last time,
  So we finally say— goodbye.
  
  [Outro]
  We’re moving on, and maybe that’s alright,
  Two honest hearts stepping into new light.
  No hard feelings, just a quiet release—
  And we’re both finding our own kind of peace.
