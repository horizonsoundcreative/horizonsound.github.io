      <p><strong>Official audio for "A Quiet Little Voice" by Horizon Sound.</strong></p>
  
      <p>“A Quiet Little Voice” is an upbeat, empowering pop track with a bright, confident female vocal and modern, energetic production. Crisp drums, warm synths, rhythmic guitars, and uplifting melodic hooks create a polished, radio‑ready sound with a feel‑good, celebratory mood. The song features expressive female vocals only — no male vocals.</p>
  
      <p>This track tells the story of a girl who always knew who she was — beginning with a quiet inner voice that guided her through self‑discovery, transformation, love, and the creation of her own family. It’s a song about courage, identity, and the beauty of becoming yourself. Hopeful, emotional, and full of forward momentum, “New Beginnings” celebrates the journey toward living openly and joyfully.</p>

    lyrics_html: |
      <p>[Verse]<br>
      In a crowded delivery room<br>
      A nurse says to the new mother “Congratulations, It's a boy."<br>
      But if they had been listening<br>
      They would have heard her little voice saying<br>
      "Mama, It's me. It's your daughter, the one you always wanted."<br>
      It's been a journey to here, but she's here now<br>
      Laying in your arms—<br>
      A new beginning</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]<br>
      But it all began with that quiet little voice that always knew who she was<br>
      And it was the courage to listen that got her here today</p>
  
      <p>[Verse]<br>
      And that quiet little voice turned into hormones that slowly started to soften her features<br>
      She began to see herself for the first time<br>
      Her new reflection began to match her soul<br>
      That quiet little voice was replaced with the confidence to speak up and be heard<br>
      The confidence to finally say yes to the boy that she had been seeing and to love him fully<br>
      To let herself be loved<br>
      The quiet little voice turned into their loud declaration of love</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]<br>
      And that love turned into an engagement<br>
      And the engagement will turn into a marriage<br>
      And one day<br>
      That marriage will bring forth new life</p>
  
      <p>[Verse]<br>
      In a crowded delivery room<br>
      A nurse will say to her<br>
      "Congratulations<br>
      It's a girl."<br>
      But she'll already know<br>
      Because she learned a long time ago to always listen to that quiet little voice<br>
      Because it was that voice that knew the whole time<br>
      And it was that voice that got her here today</p>
  
      <p>[Outro]<br>
      A new beginning</p>

      <p>[Intro]<br>
      We gave it all, but sometimes love just fades,<br>
      Two honest hearts walking different ways.<br>
      No hard feelings, just a quiet truth—<br>
      Now we’re learning how to start brand new.</p>
  
      <p>[Verse 1]<br>
      Woke up slower, silence hanging in the room,<br>
      Trying to make peace with the things I can’t undo.<br>
      Realized I took us for granted on the way—<br>
      Now I’m learning how to face myself today.</p>
  
      <p>[Pre Chorus]<br>
      I’m not holding onto what we couldn’t save,<br>
      Just thinking ’bout the times I wasn’t there.<br>
      A little space, a little honesty—<br>
      And I’m feeling more like me.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]<br>
      I’m opening up, changing priorities,<br>
      Learning to see what others need.<br>
      I’m choosing me tonight.<br>
      (I’m choosing me tonight.)<br>
      No hard feelings, just a little more truth—<br>
      For me to change, I’ve got to grow.<br>
      Yeah, I’m— choosing me.</p>
  
      <p>[Verse 2]<br>
      I’ve been feeling you every place I go,<br>
      But it’s fading fast as I learn to grow.<br>
      I’m still haunted, but I can see the light,<br>
      Didn’t expect this strength to feel so right.</p>
  
      <p>[Pre Chorus]<br>
      It’s not about the love we couldn’t keep,<br>
      It’s learning to be the man I’m meant to be.<br>
      A little truth, a little clarity—<br>
      And I’m slowly finding my way back to me.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]<br>
      I’m opening up, changing priorities,<br>
      Learning to see what others need.<br>
      I’m choosing me tonight.<br>
      (I’m choosing me tonight.)<br>
      No hard feelings, just a little more truth—<br>
      For me to change, I’ve got to grow.<br>
      Yeah, I’m— choosing me.</p>
  
      <p>[Bridge]<br>
      I wasn’t there in the ways I meant to be,<br>
      But I understand now why I pulled away.<br>
      Got a little wiser, got a little light—<br>
      And I’m leaning in to what feels right.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]<br>
      I’m opening up, changing priorities,<br>
      Learning to see what others need.<br>
      I’m choosing me tonight.<br>
      (I’m choosing me tonight.)<br>
      No hard feelings, just a little more truth—<br>
      For me to change, I’ve got to grow.<br>
      Yeah, I’m choosing me tonight.<br>
      I’m— choosing me.</p>
  
      <p>[Outro]<br>
      We’re moving on, and maybe that’s alright,<br>
      Two honest hearts stepping into new light.<br>
      No hard feelings, just a quiet release—<br>
      And we’re both finding our own kind of peace.</p>

      <p>[Intro]<br>
      We gave it all, but sometimes love just fades,<br>
      Two honest hearts walking different ways.<br>
      No hard feelings, just a quiet truth—<br>
      Now we’re learning how to start brand new.</p>
  
      <p>[Verse 1]<br>
      Woke up easy, sunlight dancing on my face,<br>
      Coffee on the counter, quiet filling up the space.<br>
      Didn’t know I missed the way the mornings used to feel—<br>
      Guess being alone is finally helping me heal.</p>
  
      <p>[Pre Chorus]<br>
      I’m not running from the memories we made,<br>
      Just realizing I’m better with a little more space.<br>
      A little breath, a little room to see—<br>
      And I’m starting to come back to me.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]<br>
      I’m finally breathing, letting my soul shine,<br>
      Finding pieces of myself I left behind,<br>
      I’m choosing me tonight.<br>
      (I’m choosing me tonight.)<br>
      No hard feelings, just a little more peace,<br>
      Learning to embrace the girl I used to be—<br>
      Yeah, I’m choosing me.</p>
  
      <p>[Verse 2]<br>
      I’ve been laughing at the little things again,<br>
      Dancing in the kitchen, calling up old friends.<br>
      Didn’t know how much I’d lost along the way—<br>
      Now I’m taking back the colors I let fade.</p>
  
      <p>[Pre Chorus]<br>
      It’s not about the love we couldn’t keep,<br>
      It’s waking up to things I’d put off too long.<br>
      A little hope, a little clarity—<br>
      And I’m finally where I’m meant to be.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]<br>
      I’m finally breathing, letting my soul shine,<br>
      Finding pieces of myself I left behind,<br>
      I’m choosing me tonight.<br>
      (I’m choosing me tonight.)<br>
      No hard feelings, just a little more peace,<br>
      Learning to embrace the girl I used to be—<br>
      Yeah, I’m choosing me.</p>
  
      <p>[Bridge]<br>
      I’m not closing any doors, just opening my own,<br>
      Learning I can walk a little farther on my own.<br>
      Got a little stronger, got a little light—<br>
      And I’m holding onto what feels right.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]<br>
      I’m finally breathing, letting my soul shine,<br>
      Finding pieces of myself I left behind,<br>
      I’m choosing me tonight.<br>
      (I’m choosing me tonight.)<br>
      No hard feelings, just a little more peace,<br>
      Learning to embrace the girl I used to be—<br>
      Yeah, I’m choosing me tonight.<br>
      I’m choosing me.</p>
  
      <p>[Outro]<br>
      We’re moving on, and maybe that’s alright,<br>
      Two honest hearts stepping into new light.<br>
      No hard feelings, just a quiet release—<br>
      And we’re both finding our own kind of peace.</p>
