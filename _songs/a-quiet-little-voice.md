lyrics: |
  [Verse]
  In a crowded delivery room
  A nurse says to the new mother “Congratulations, It's a boy."
  But if they had been listening
  They would have heard her little voice saying
  "Mama, It's me. It's your daughter, the one you always wanted."
  It's been a journey to here, but she's here now
  Laying in your arms—
  A new beginning
  
  [Chorus]
  But it all began with that quiet little voice that always knew who she was
  And it was the courage to listen that got her here today
  
  [Verse]
  And that quiet little voice turned into hormones that slowly started to soften her features
  She began to see herself for the first time
  Her new reflection began to match her soul
  That quiet little voice was replaced with the confidence to speak up and be heard
  The confidence to finally say yes to the boy that she had been seeing and to love him fully
  To let herself be loved
  The quiet little voice turned into their loud declaration of love
  
  [Chorus]
  And that love turned into an engagement
  And the engagement will turn into a marriage
  And one day
  That marriage will bring forth new life
  
  [Verse]
  In a crowded delivery room
  A nurse will say to her
  "Congratulations
  It's a girl."
  But she'll already know
  Because she learned a long time ago to always listen to that quiet little voice
  Because it was that voice that knew the whole time
  And it was that voice that got her here today
  
  [Outro]
  A new beginning
