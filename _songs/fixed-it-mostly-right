  [Intro]
  If it ain’t broke,
  Then I didn’t try to fix it…
  
  [Verse 1]
  Woke up this mornin’ feelin’ handy,
  Thought I’d fix the dryer door.
  Grabbed a wrench, a roll of duct tape,
  And a beer from the night before.
  I tightened somethin’ somewhere,
  Heard a pop and let out a sigh…
  Now the whole dang house smells funny —
  But hey, I fixed it mostly right.
  
  [Chorus]
  Fixed it mostly right before Mama gets home,
  Fixed it mostly right even if it goes wrong.
  If it sparks, smokes, shakes, or ignites,
  Just call it a win if it stays upright.
  It’s wobblin’ a little, but that’s alright —
  Long as I fixed it mostly right.
  
  [Verse 2]
  Tried patchin’ up the kitchen sink,
  But I made it worse somehow.
  Water shootin’ like a fountain,
  Dog’s swimmin’ ’round the house now.
  Neighbor asked if I need help,
  I said, “Buddy, grab a flashlight!”
  Then the pipe blew through the window —
  But hey, I fixed it mostly right.
  
  [Chorus]
  Fixed it mostly right before Mama gets home,
  Fixed it mostly right even if it goes wrong.
  If it sparks, smokes, shakes, or ignites,
  Just call it a win if it stays upright.
  It’s wobblin’ a little, but that’s alright —
  Long as I fixed it mostly right.
  
  [Bridge]
  Sirens blarin’ down the street,
  Neighbor’s laughin’ on the lawn…
  The dog’s swimmin’ out a second‑floor window,
  And Mama’s due home anytime.
  
  [Chorus]
  Fixed it mostly right before Mama gets home,
  Fixed it mostly right even if it goes wrong.
  If it sparks, smokes, shakes, or ignites,
  Just call it a win if it stays upright.
  It’s wobblin’ a little, but that’s alright —
  Long as I fixed it mostly right.
  
  [Outro]
  Mama pulled into the driveway,
  Saw the mess that I had caused…
  She said, “What in tarnation…?”
  I said, “Relax… I fixed it mostly right.”
