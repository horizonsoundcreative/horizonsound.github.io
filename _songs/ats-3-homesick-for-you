  Official audio for “Homesick for You” by Horizon Sound.

  “Homesick for You” is a soft, reflective emotional pop ballad built around gentle piano, warm pads, subtle strings, and a spacious, nostalgic atmosphere. The warm expressive female vocal brings a tender ache to the story — not longing for a lost love, but longing for the version of herself she became when she felt safe.
  
  The song explores the quiet grief of losing the person you were in a relationship that once felt like home. She isn’t missing the romance or the heartbreak — she’s missing the softness, the bravery, the lightness she carried back then. It’s a search for the self she left behind, and a hope that she can find her way back to that version of herself again.
  
  🎧 Vibe: soft, nostalgic, reflective
  🎤 Vocals: warm female lead, intimate phrasing, emotional tone
  🎛️ Production: gentle piano, warm pads, subtle strings, airy reverb
  ⚡ Mood: longing, introspective, quietly emotional

lyrics: |
  [INTRO]
  I miss a place I can’t return to…
  A version of myself I was with you.
  
  [VERSE 1]
  There was a light inside my laughter,
  A softness in the way I breathed.
  You held the parts I hid from others,
  Made the broken feel complete.
  Now I’m going through my memories,
  Trying hard to find that girl —
  But she’s somewhere in the distance,
  In a long‑forgotten world.
  
  [PRE‑CHORUS]
  I don’t miss the way we ended…
  I miss who I was back then.
  
  [CHORUS]
  I’m homesick for you —
  Not the love, not the hurt, but the me I used to be.
  Homesick for the way
  I felt safe enough to let my armor fall.
  I’m not longing for your arms,
  Just the calm before the storms.
  I’m missing who I grew into…
  I’m homesick for you.
  
  [VERSE 2]
  I try to find her in the mirror,
  But her smile doesn’t look like mine.
  She was softer, she was braver,
  She believed in brighter times.
  Now I’m trying hard to reach her,
  Trying to bring her back again—
  But it’s hard to find the pieces
  When you don’t know where they went.
  
  [PRE‑CHORUS]
  I don’t need the past to save me…
  I just want to recognize myself again.
  
  [CHORUS]
  I’m homesick for you —
  Not the love, not the hurt, but the me I used to be.
  Homesick for the way
  I felt safe enough to let my armor fall.
  I’m not longing for your arms,
  Just the calm before the storms.
  I’m missing who I grew into…
  I’m homesick for you.
  
  [BRIDGE]
  Maybe I’ve always been her,
  Just shining in the light you gave.
  Maybe I can bring her back
  Without retracing every ache.
  Maybe healing isn’t finding you —
  It’s finding me again
  In all the places I hid.
  
  [CHORUS]
  I’m homesick for you —
  Not the love, not the hurt, but the me I used to be.
  Homesick for the way
  I felt safe enough to let my armor fall.
  I’m not longing for your arms,
  Just the calm before the storms.
  I’m missing who I grew into…
  I’m homesick for you.
  
  [OUTRO]
  I miss her still…
  But I’m coming home.
