  [Intro]
  Raise a glass…
  To every long day
  That got us here.
  
  [Verse 1]
  We’ve been battered,
  We’ve been bruised,
  We’ve been running on fumes.
  We’ve been overworked and silent,
  We’ve been screaming in our heads.
  But somehow we’re still standing,
  Even when the week got tough —
  Guess the world can try to break us,
  But together we’re enough!
  
  [Pre‑Chorus]
  So here’s to every long week 
  That somehow we survived.
  
  [Chorus]
  Here’s to us!
  All those that keep going,
  When the going gets tough.
  All those that never give up, 
  Here’s to us!
  To the times we thought we’d lose —
  But we somehow made it through.
  So raise ’em up…
  Here’s to us!
  
  [Verse 2]
  We’ve been lost, we’ve been restless,
  We’ve been trying just to cope.
  We’ve been drowning in the deadlines,
  We’ve been clinging onto hope.
  But every time we stumbled,
  We got back up again—
  Now we’re stronger for the pressure
  And together we’re enough!
  
  [Pre‑Chorus]
  So here’s to every long week 
  That somehow we survived.
  
  [Chorus]
  Here’s to us!
  All those that keep going,
  When the going gets tough.
  All those that never give up, 
  Here’s to us!
  To the times we thought we’d lose —
  But we somehow made it through.
  So raise ’em up…
  Here’s to us!
  
  [Bridge]
  We’re still here
  (We’re still here)
  We’re still strong
  (We’re still strong)
  We pushed through all week long
  (all week long)
  
  [Chorus]
  Here’s to us!
  All those that keep going,
  When the going gets tough.
  All those that never give up, 
  Here’s to us!
  To the times we thought we’d lose —
  But we somehow made it through.
  So raise ’em up…
  Here’s to us!
  
  [Outro]
  Raise a glass…
  We earned this.
