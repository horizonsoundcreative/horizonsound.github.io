  Official audio for “Unsent Letters” by Horizon Sound.

  “Unsent Letters” is an intimate, confessional emotional pop ballad built around warm expressive female vocals, soft piano, gentle strings, airy pads, and spacious reverb. It carries the late‑night quiet of someone pouring their heart onto the page — not to be read, but to finally be released.
  
  The song follows a woman who writes letter after letter to the person she lost, filling pages with the truths she never had the courage to say out loud. Some letters ache with longing, some with regret, and one — written to herself — becomes the first step toward healing. “Unsent Letters” captures the bittersweet ritual of writing to let go, the ache of unspoken words, and the quiet strength found in finally choosing yourself.
  
  🎧 Vibe: intimate, confessional, late‑night
  🎤 Vocals: warm female lead, smooth vibrato, emotional phrasing
  🎛️ Production: soft piano, warm strings, airy pads, subtle drums
  ⚡ Mood: tender, reflective, quietly cathartic

lyrics: |
  [Intro]
  Another page written, 
  But I’m too afraid to send.
  
  [Verse 1]
  I wrote you in the early hours,
  When the world was fast asleep.
  Told you how I missed your laughter,
  How your silence cut too deep.
  I folded up the letter,
  And sealed it with a kiss—
  Left it in a drawer somewhere,
  Where all my unsent letters sit.
  
  [Pre Chorus]
  Every word I never told you
  Still finds their way back to me.
  
  [Chorus]
  These are my unsent letters —
  All the things I couldn’t say when we were together.
  Every truth I tried to hide
  Comes spilling out in ink tonight.
  You’ll never read the words I penned,
  But they haunt me every night.
  I write, I fold, I breathe again…
  My unsent letters.
  
  [Verse 2]
  I wrote you on a Sunday morning,
  When I could still feel you in my bed.
  Told you how the quiet hurt me,
  How I missed the words you never said.
  I tried to find forgiveness,
  But I just came up dry —
  Guess some scars only linger,
  They never truly heal.
  
  [Pre Chorus]
  Every line I never sent you
  Still keeps tugging at my soul.
  
  [Chorus]
  These are my unsent letters —
  All the things I couldn’t say when we were together.
  Every truth I tried to hide
  Comes spilling out in ink tonight.
  You’ll never read the words I penned,
  But they haunt me every night.
  I write, I fold, I breathe again…
  My unsent letters.
  
  [Bridge]
  I wrote one to me and addressed it,
  Signed it with a trembling hand.
  Told myself to stop the pining,
  Told myself to live again.
  Said, “You don’t need his answers,
  You don’t need what might have been.”
  It’s the only letter I’ve written
  That I might just send.
  
  [Chorus]
  These are my unsent letters —
  Every lie, every hope I held together.
  All the hurt i have inside, 
  Now pours out of me, finally free.
  You’ll never read the words I penned,
  But I’m learning how my story ends.
  I write, I fold, I breathe again…
  My unsent letters.
  
  [Outro]
  Another page written…
  This one’s meant for me.
