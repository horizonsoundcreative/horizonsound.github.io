  Official audio for “Saltwater” by Horizon Sound.

  “Saltwater” is a flowing, tidal emotional pop ballad built on warm expressive female vocals, soft piano, warm strings, airy pads, and gentle drums. It rises and falls like waves — a cathartic release of everything held back, everything unsaid, everything too heavy to carry alone.
  
  The song follows a woman trying to hold back the emotional ocean inside her, only to realize that letting the tears fall is the first step toward healing. Each wave brings memory, ache, and clarity. “Saltwater” captures the cleansing power of release, the beauty in breaking open, and the quiet transformation that comes when you finally stop fighting the tide.
  
  🎧 Vibe: flowing, emotional, cinematic
  🎤 Vocals: warm female lead, rich tone, expressive phrasing
  🎛️ Production: soft piano, warm strings, airy pads, gentle drums
  ⚡ Mood: cathartic, cleansing, tender
