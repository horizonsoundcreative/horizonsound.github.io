  [Intro]
  I was standing in the shadows,
  Feeling lost and terrified —
  
  [Verse 1] 
  I was fading in the darkness, couldn’t recognize myself,
  Every sunrise felt like nothing, every heartbeat felt flat.
  I was drowning in the silence, losing pieces of my mind,
  Trying hard to feel like someone, but the truth was never kind.
  I swore that I would stop, I would turn my life around,
  But every promise that I made kept crashing to the ground.
  And I knew I couldn’t keep on living trapped inside this pain,
  Had to find a spark of hope if I would ever truly live again.
  
  [Pre‑Chorus 1] 
  I hit the ground so hard it shook me,
  Saw the truth I couldn’t hide.
  If I didn’t choose to change now,
  I knew I would never survive.
  
  [Chorus]
  So I’m learning how to live again,
  Learning how to breathe again,
  Stepping out of all the darkness I’d been existing in.
  I’m reaching for the light again,
  Fighting for my life again,
  Finding strength in places I thought I’d never find.
  I’m not who I was —
  I’m learning how to live.
  
  [Verse 2] 
  Every morning felt uncertain, like a stranger in my skin,
  But I held on to the small things just to feel myself again.
  I was shaky, I was fragile, but I kept on standing tall,
  Every stumble taught me something, every step a kind of call.
  And the colors started coming back in ways I’d never seen,
  Little victories reminding me of who I could be.
  
  [Pre‑Chorus 2] 
  I’m not the same as when I started,
  I’m stronger than the fear inside.
  Every day I choose the future,
  Every day I choose to try.
  
  [Chorus] 
  So I’m learning how to live again,
  Learning how to breathe again,
  Stepping out of all the darkness I’d been existing in.
  I’m reaching for the light again,
  Fighting for my life again,
  Finding strength in places I thought I’d never find.
  I’m not who I was —
  I’m learning how to live.
  
  [Bridge]
  Now the sky feels wide and open,
  And the world feels new and kind.
  I can hear my heartbeat steady,
  Feel the hope I’d left behind.
  I’m not perfect, but I’m standing,
  And I’m proud of what I’ve done —
  I survived the storm inside me,
  Now I’m stepping toward the sun.
  
  [Final Chorus]
  Yeah, I’m learning how to live again,
  Learning how to breathe again,
  Walking forward with a strength I never knew I had within.
  I’m reaching for the light again,
  Fighting for my life again,
  And every day I’m proving I can leave the dark behind.
  I’m not who I was —
  I’m learning how to live.
  
  [Outro] 
  And if you’re standing in the shadows,
  Feeling lost and terrified —
  Take my hand, I’ll walk beside you.
  Together we can learn to live.
