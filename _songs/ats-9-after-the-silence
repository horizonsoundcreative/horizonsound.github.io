  “After the Silence” is a calm, reflective emotional pop ballad shaped by warm expressive female vocals, soft piano, warm strings, airy pads, and gentle drums. It carries the quiet strength that follows a long storm — the moment when the noise fades, the dust settles, and healing finally has room to breathe.
  
  The song follows a woman standing in the stillness left behind after heartbreak. She traces the cracks, acknowledges the wreckage, and slowly discovers a softer, steadier version of herself emerging in the quiet. “After the Silence” captures the slow rise of hope, the courage to trust again, and the quiet power of rebuilding from the inside out.

lyrics: |
  [Verse 1]
  The storm has finally faded,
  Left a quiet in its wake.
  All the words we left unspoken
  Start to rise and resonate.
  Now I’m standing in the stillness
  Where the wreckage used to be —
  And in the space you left behind,
  I feel a softer part of me.
  
  [Pre‑Chorus]
  I’ve been learning how to breathe again
  In a world that doesn’t feel the same.
  
  [Chorus]
  After the silence…
  I can hear my heartbeat steady for the first time in a while.
  There’s a softness in the quiet that I never thought I’d find again.
  After the silence…
  I’m not who I was before I fell,
  But I’m stronger than the pieces of it all.
  And I’m finally finding light again…
  After the silence.
  
  [Verse 2]
  I trace the cracks along the walls —
  Every fracture tells the truth.
  I was trying to hold my world together
  Even though I was breaking inside.
  But now the calm is settling
  Like a blanket on my skin —
  And in the quiet of this moment,
  I feel something new begin.
  
  [Pre‑Chorus]
  I’m still learning how to trust myself,
  But I’m standing on my own.
  
  [Chorus]
  After the silence…
  I can hear my heartbeat steady for the first time in a while.
  There’s a softness in the quiet that I never thought I’d find again.
  After the silence…
  I’m not who I was before I fell,
  But I’m stronger than the pieces of it all.
  And I’m finally finding light again…
  After the silence.
  
  [Bridge]
  Maybe healing isn’t sudden,
  Maybe peace is slow to rise.
  Maybe strength is just the courage
  To sit with what survived.
  But in the hush that fills this room,
  In the calm that meets my eyes —
  I feel the world returning
  One small breath at a time.
  
  [Final Chorus]
  After the silence…
  I can hear my own voice calling from a place I thought was gone.
  There’s a warmth inside the quiet where the hurt can’t linger on.
  I’m not who I was before I fell,
  But I’m learning I don’t need to be.
  And I’m finally stepping into light again…
  After the silence.
  
  [Outro]
  The quiet feels unfamiliar…
  But it’s starting to feel like mine.
