lyrics: |
  [Verse 1]
  I was walking through the darkness,
  With no light to guide my way,
  Every breath felt cold and lonely,
  Like the night refused to fade.
  Then you found me in the silence,
  Held me close against your side,
  And suddenly the world felt brighter,
  Like the sunrise breaking wide.
  
  [Pre‑Chorus]
  I feel my heartbeat getting stronger,
  All my fears are losing ground,
  And the moment that you touched me,
  Everything just turned around.
  
  [Chorus]
  And we will fight to stay together,
  Side by side forever,
  We’ll never let each other down.
  And when the world is pressing on us,
  We’ll rise beyond the wreckage,
  We’ll never let each other down—
  Yeah, we’ll never let each other down.
  
  [Verse 2]
  I remember all the moments
  When I almost walked away,
  Thinking I was meant to run
  ’Til you taught me how to stay.
  Now our fire’s burning brighter,
  And my body’s feeling lighter,
  Every step we take together
  Feels like nothing’s in our way.
  
  [Pre‑Chorus]
  I feel my heartbeat getting stronger,
  All my fears are losing ground,
  And the moment that you touched me,
  Everything just turned around.
  
  [Chorus]
  And we will fight to stay together,
  Side by side forever,
  We’ll never let each other down.
  And when the world is pressing on us,
  We’ll rise beyond the wreckage,
  We’ll never let each other down—
  Yeah, we’ll never let each other down.
  
  [Bridge]
  Oh, you’re all that I need,
  All that I need, it’s true.
  Please just hold me forever,
  Please hold me forever…
  
  [Chorus]
  And we will fight to stay together,
  Side by side forever,
  We’ll never let each other down.
  And when the world is pressing on us,
  We’ll rise beyond the wreckage,
  We’ll never let each other down,
  Yeah, we’ll never let each other down —
  Never let each other down.
  
  [Outro]
  Side by side forever…
  Side by side forever…
  We’ll never let each other down…
  Never let each other down…
