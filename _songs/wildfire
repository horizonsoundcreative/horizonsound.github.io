lyrics: |
  [Verse 1]
  He liked his women quiet—
  she was anything but.
  Thought he could tame her—
  but he was dead wrong.
  She was born with lightning
  Surgin’ right beneath her skin,
  A spark he never noticed
  ’til the fire raged.
  He tried to hold her down,
  tried to break her stride,
  But all he did was feed the fire deep inside.
  
  [Pre‑Chorus]
  She ain’t the kind you tame,
  She ain’t the kind you cage—
  She’s the kind that rises up
  when you fan the flame.
  
  [Chorus]
  He tried to hold her down,
  she burned him to the ground.
  ’Cause wildfire women don’t break,
  They stand, rise, and fight.
  She’s got fire in her veins,
  She’s got fury in her heart—
  Yeah, she’s wildfire,
  and she’s burnin’ hot tonight…
  
  [Verse 2]
  She packed her things
  in a beat‑up bag,
  Left his empty promises
  and didn’t look back.
  She hit the highway fast,
  All the windows down,
  Radio turned up loud,
  hair flyin’ in that Oklahoma wind.
  With every mile, every breath,
  she felt her fire rage.
  
  [Pre‑Chorus]
  She ain’t the kind you tame,
  She ain’t the kind you cage—
  She’s the kind that rises up
  when you fan the flame.
  
  [Chorus]
  He tried to hold her down,
  she burned him to the ground.
  ’Cause wildfire women don’t break,
  They stand, rise, and fight.
  She’s got fire in her veins,
  She’s got fury in her heart—
  Yeah, she’s wildfire,
  and she’s burnin’ hot tonight…
  
  [Bridge]
  She’s the smoke you see for miles,
  she’s the heat you can’t outrun,
  She’s the storm that finds its power
  in the rising of the sun.
  You can try to hold her back,
  but she was born to shine—
  A force of nature walkin’,
  and she won’t be confined.
  
  [Chorus]
  He tried to hold her down,
  she burned him to the ground.
  ’Cause wildfire women don’t break,
  They stand, rise, and fight.
  She’s got fire in her veins,
  She’s got fury in her heart—
  Yeah, she’s wildfire,
  and she’s burnin’ hot tonight…
  
  [Outro]
  No chains, no fear,
  just a woman burnin’ bright—
  Wildfire.
  Still glowin’ in the dark,
  leavin’ ashes where she’s been,
  A heart that won’t be broken,
  A flame that won’t give in.
  Wildfire.
