  [Verse 1]
  Summer days, late nights, you and me in paradise,
  Neon glow, warm breeze, dancing barefoot in the sea.
  We were young, we were free, we were living in a dream
  
  [Pre-Chorus]
  Twelve weeks in Key West, ooh, just you and me
  
  [Chorus]
  We were burning bright, kissing on the boardwalk,
  Laughing while the waves crashed, taking all our clothes off.
  When the sun dips low, boy, I already know—
  You’ll slip out of my bed, gone before the morning.
  I don’t wanna wake up with my heart broken.
  If our fire dies when the sun sets…
  Baby, don’t you let the summer end.
  
  [Verse 2]
  Blue eyes, sun‑kissed, couldn’t believe you exist,
  Soft lips, first kiss, nights I never could resist.
  We were young, we were free, living out a perfect dream—
  
  [Pre-Chorus] 
  Twelve weeks in Key West, ooh, just you and me
  
  [Chorus]
  We were burning bright, kissing on the boardwalk,
  Laughing while the waves crashed, taking all our clothes off.
  When the sun dips low, boy, I already know—
  You’ll slip out of my bed, gone before the morning.
  I don’t wanna wake up with my heart broken.
  If our fire dies when the sun sets…
  Baby, don’t you let the summer end.
  
  [Bridge]
  Hold me like you mean it,
  Say you’re gonna stay.
  Tell me that this feeling
  Doesn’t fade away.
  Hold me like you mean it,
  Say you’re gonna stay.
  Tell me that this summer
  Doesn’t slip away.
  
  [Chorus]
  We were burning bright, kissing on the boardwalk,
  Laughing while the waves crashed, taking all our clothes off.
  When the sun dips low, boy, I already know—
  You’ll slip out of my bed, gone before the morning.
  I don’t wanna wake up with my heart broken.
  If our fire dies when the sun sets…
  Baby, don’t you let our summer end.
