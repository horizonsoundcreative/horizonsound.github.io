  Official audio for “If You’d Asked” by Horizon Sound.

  “If You’d Asked” is a slow, aching emotional pop ballad shaped by warm expressive female vocals, soft piano, warm strings, subtle drums, and spacious reverb. It carries the weight of regret — the heartbreak of a love that ended not with a fight, but with silence.
  
  The song tells the story of someone who would have stayed, fought, rebuilt, and tried again… if only the other person had asked. She had answers ready for questions that never came, hope ready for a chance that never arrived. Instead, the door closed quietly, leaving her with all the words she never got to say. “If You’d Asked” captures the pain of unspoken love and the ache of a goodbye that didn’t have to happen.
  
  🎧 Vibe: slow, cinematic, emotional
  🎤 Vocals: warm female lead, intimate delivery, aching tone
  🎛️ Production: soft piano, warm strings, subtle drums, atmospheric reverb
  ⚡ Mood: regretful, tender, heartbreaking

  [Intro]
  I keep replaying the moment
  When you let go without a word
  
  [Verse 1]
  You said you didn’t want to hurt me,
  So you walked away instead.
  You left the questions on the table,
  And the words you left unsaid.
  I was waiting for a reason,
  For a sign you’d change your mind —
  But you never turned around,
  Never gave us one more try.
  
  [Pre-Chorus]
  And I wonder if you ever knew
  How close I was to choosing you.
  
  [Chorus]
  If you’d asked…
  I would’ve stayed,
  I would’ve fought, I would’ve held you through the fall.
  If you’d asked…
  I would’ve tried to change, tried to bring the fire back.
  But you never said a word,
  Never let me heal the hurt.
  You just left me in the past…
  If only you’d asked.
  
  [Verse 2]
  I rehearsed all the answers
  To the questions you never asked.
  I was ready for the hard work,
  To rebuild what we had.
  But you made the choice in silence,
  Closed the door without a sound—
  And the stillness in that moment
  Told me you were truly gone.
  
  [Pre-Chorus]
  And I wonder if you ever knew
  How close I was to choosing you.
  
  [Chorus]
  If you’d asked…
  I would’ve stayed,
  I would’ve fought, I would’ve held you through the fall.
  If you’d asked…
  I would’ve tried to change, tried to bring the fire back.
  But you never said a word,
  Never let me heal the hurt.
  You just left me in the past…
  If only you’d asked.
  
  [Bridge]
  Maybe you were afraid to need me,
  Maybe your pride got in the way.
  Maybe loving me was too much,
  More than you could ever say.
  But I would’ve carried it all,
  If you’d only let me try —
  You’ll never know a time
  Where we didn’t say goodbye.
  
  [Chorus]
  If you’d asked…
  I would’ve stayed, I would’ve fought, I would’ve held you through the cracks.
  If you’d asked…
  I would’ve changed the things you needed, tried to bring the fire back.
  But you never said a word,
  Never let me heal the hurt.
  Now I’m learning to let go at last…
  Of what we lost
  When you never asked.
  
  [Outro]
  You never asked…
  So I walked away…
