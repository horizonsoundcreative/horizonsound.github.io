  Official audio for “Missing Stamp” by Horizon Sound.

  “Missing Stamp” is an emotional acoustic‑pop ballad with soft piano, warm guitars, and expressive female vocals. The production leans intimate and reflective, capturing the ache of two friends who drifted apart as life pulled them in different directions. Subtle strings and gentle percussion give the song a cinematic sadness, while the melody carries a quiet longing.
  
  This song follows the moment when one of them realizes the dream they once shared — Venice — never happened. The passport is still blank, the promise still unkept, and the distance between them feels heavier than ever. “Missing Stamp” is the middle chapter of the Venice Trilogy, the emotional low point where the dream feels lost but not forgotten.

lyrics: |
  [Intro]
  We once swore that someday was ours,
  passports in hand and a world to chase.
  Now I’m older, and my pages are full—
  except the one I saved for you.
  
  [Verse 1]
  I’ve filled my passport pages,
  chased the sun from shore to shore,
  Tokyo lights, Paris nights—
  I always wanted more.
  But every time I flip the pages,
  there’s a space that pulls me back,
  The trip we swore we’d take someday—
  the one that never came.
  
  [Pre Chorus]
  You built a life with love and laughter — kids’ drawings on your fridge,
  I kept on moving, kept exploring, but one dream stayed out of reach.
  
  [Chorus]
  There’s one empty page in the book of my travels.
  A missing stamp that belongs to you and me.
  One promise we made all those years ago.
  Venice is waiting, but I won’t go without you.
  Some dreams don’t mean a thing if we’re not together.
  A tear rolls down as I see—
  my missing stamp…
  
  [Verse 2]
  I was scrolling through old notes again,
  thinking where I’d go next spring,
  And there it was — our Venice trip,
  still saved the way we left it back then.
  Hotel — Excursions — Gondola ride, 
  the notes we wrote when we were teens,
  Two girls who swore we’d chase the sun —
  a ghost of who we were.
  
  [Pre Chorus]
  I almost called to ask you,
  but your world is full and mine is free.
  So I closed the tab— 
  closed my passport—
  let the moment slip away.
  
  [Chorus]
  There’s one empty page in the book of my travels.
  A missing stamp that belongs to you and me.
  One promise we made all those years ago.
  Venice is waiting, but I won’t go without you.
  Some dreams don’t mean a thing if we’re not together.
  A tear rolls down as I see—
  my missing stamp…
  
  [Bridge]
  Maybe someday still belongs to us,
  just not the way it did when we were kids.
  You found your sun in the life you’re living,
  I chased mine across the sea.
  But Venice…
  Venice was always meant for two —
  and I can’t make that trip alone.
  
  [Chorus]
  There’s one empty page in the book of my travels.
  A missing stamp that belongs to you and me.
  One promise we made all those years ago.
  Venice is waiting, but I won’t go without you.
  Some dreams don’t mean a thing if we’re not together.
  A tear rolls down as I see—
  my missing stamp…
  
  [Outro]
  One blank page, one old promise,
  a place I won’t go alone.
  Someday still whispers softly,
  but Venice isn’t mine to own.
  So I tuck my passport gently in the drawer.
