lyrics: |
  [Verse 1]
  I lay your letters on the table,
  let every single word sink in.
  You say you’re safe, but I still feel it—
  the fear beneath the lines you send.
  I press my hand against this heartbeat,
  growing stronger every day.
  I whisper stories of her father
  With the promise you’ll be coming home someday.
  
  [Chorus]
  So I leave a porch light on for you every night,
  I talk to her about her daddy and the battles that you fight.
  I’m lonely but I’m not alone, she helps me to be strong,
  ’cause your love is worth the waiting and for you I’m holding on.
  
  [Verse 2]
  Nights get long and I get quiet,
  I whisper your name like it’s a prayer.
  The world feels heavy when it’s silent,
  and the quiet makes it hard to breathe.
  I keep your jacket by the doorway,
  just the way it was when you left.
  I breathe it in when I get lonely—
  the scent of you still lingers here.
  
  [Chorus]
  So I leave a porch light on for you every night,
  I talk to her about her daddy and the battles that you fight.
  I’m lonely but I’m not alone, she helps me to be strong,
  ’cause your love is worth the waiting and for you I’m holding on.
  
  [Verse 3]
  Doctor says it won’t be much longer,
  she’s almost ready for the world.
  I wish that you could feel her kicking—
  the little rhythms as she moves.
  But I hold on to every promise,
  every wish and every prayer,
  counting down the days ’til you come back,
  hoping I’ll wake and find you here.
  
  [Bridge]
  I know the distance feels so endless,
  but my love is like a beacon straight to you.
  So I’ll keep the porch light shining
  until your footsteps lead you safely home to us.
  
  [Chorus]
  So I keep the porch light on, it’s guiding you tonight,
  I tell her that her daddy’s on his way back to our light.
  I’m lonely but I’m not alone, she’s where my hope belongs,
  ’cause the love we’ve held between us has been shining all along.
  
  [Outro]
  Now you’re finally home,
  with our daughter in your arms.
  We made it through the shadows—
  now please stay here where our love shines for you.
