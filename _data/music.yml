      <p>[Verse]
      In a crowded delivery room
      A nurse says to the new mother “Congratulations, It's a boy."
      But if they had been listening
      They would have heard her little voice saying
      "Mama, It's me. It's your daughter, the one you always wanted."
      It's been a journey to here, but she's here now
      Laying in your arms—
      A new beginning</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]
      But it all began with that quiet little voice that always knew who she was
      And it was the courage to listen that got her here today</p>
  
      <p>[Verse]
      And that quiet little voice turned into hormones that slowly started to soften her features
      She began to see herself for the first time
      Her new reflection began to match her soul
      That quiet little voice was replaced with the confidence to speak up and be heard
      The confidence to finally say yes to the boy that she had been seeing and to love him fully
      To let herself be loved
      The quiet little voice turned into their loud declaration of love</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]
      And that love turned into an engagement
      And the engagement will turn into a marriage
      And one day
      That marriage will bring forth new life</p>
  
      <p>[Verse]
      In a crowded delivery room
      A nurse will say to her
      "Congratulations
      It's a girl."
      But she'll already know
      Because she learned a long time ago to always listen to that quiet little voice
      Because it was that voice that knew the whole time
      And it was that voice that got her here today</p>
  
      <p>[Outro]
      A new beginning</p>

    lyrics_html: |
      <p>[Intro]
      We gave it all, but sometimes love just fades,
      Two honest hearts walking different ways.
      No hard feelings, just a quiet truth—
      Now we’re learning how to start brand new.</p>
  
      <p>[Verse 1]
      Woke up slower, silence hanging in the room,
      Trying to make peace with the things I can’t undo.
      Realized I took us for granted on the way—
      Now I’m learning how to face myself today.</p>
  
      <p>[Pre Chorus]
      I’m not holding onto what we couldn’t save,
      Just thinking ’bout the times I wasn’t there.
      A little space, a little honesty—
      And I’m feeling more like me.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]
      I’m opening up, changing priorities,
      Learning to see what others need.
      I’m choosing me tonight.
      (I’m choosing me tonight.)
      No hard feelings, just a little more truth—
      For me to change, I’ve got to grow.
      Yeah, I’m— choosing me.</p>
  
      <p>[Verse 2]
      I’ve been feeling you every place I go,
      But it’s fading fast as I learn to grow.
      I’m still haunted, but I can see the light,
      Didn’t expect this strength to feel so right.</p>
  
      <p>[Pre Chorus]
      It’s not about the love we couldn’t keep,
      It’s learning to be the man I’m meant to be.
      A little truth, a little clarity—
      And I’m slowly finding my way back to me.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]
      I’m opening up, changing priorities,
      Learning to see what others need.
      I’m choosing me tonight.
      (I’m choosing me tonight.)
      No hard feelings, just a little more truth—
      For me to change, I’ve got to grow.
      Yeah, I’m— choosing me.</p>
  
      <p>[Bridge]
      I wasn’t there in the ways I meant to be,
      But I understand now why I pulled away.
      Got a little wiser, got a little light—
      And I’m leaning in to what feels right.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]
      I’m opening up, changing priorities,
      Learning to see what others need.
      I’m choosing me tonight.
      (I’m choosing me tonight.)
      No hard feelings, just a little more truth—
      For me to change, I’ve got to grow.
      Yeah, I’m choosing me tonight.
      I’m— choosing me.</p>
  
      <p>[Outro]
      We’re moving on, and maybe that’s alright,
      Two honest hearts stepping into new light.
      No hard feelings, just a quiet release—
      And we’re both finding our own kind of peace.</p>

    lyrics_html: |
      <p>[Intro]
      We gave it all, but sometimes love just fades,
      Two honest hearts walking different ways.
      No hard feelings, just a quiet truth—
      Now we’re learning how to start brand new.</p>
  
      <p>[Verse 1]
      Woke up easy, sunlight dancing on my face,
      Coffee on the counter, quiet filling up the space.
      Didn’t know I missed the way the mornings used to feel—
      Guess being alone is finally helping me heal.</p>
  
      <p>[Pre Chorus]
      I’m not running from the memories we made,
      Just realizing I’m better with a little more space.
      A little breath, a little room to see—
      And I’m starting to come back to me.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]
      I’m finally breathing, letting my soul shine,
      Finding pieces of myself I left behind,
      I’m choosing me tonight.
      (I’m choosing me tonight.)
      No hard feelings, just a little more peace,
      Learning to embrace the girl I used to be—
      Yeah, I’m choosing me.</p>
  
      <p>[Verse 2]
      I’ve been laughing at the little things again,
      Dancing in the kitchen, calling up old friends.
      Didn’t know how much I’d lost along the way—
      Now I’m taking back the colors I let fade.</p>
  
      <p>[Pre Chorus]
      It’s not about the love we couldn’t keep,
      It’s waking up to things I’d put off too long.
      A little hope, a little clarity—
      And I’m finally where I’m meant to be.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]
      I’m finally breathing, letting my soul shine,
      Finding pieces of myself I left behind,
      I’m choosing me tonight.
      (I’m choosing me tonight.)
      No hard feelings, just a little more peace,
      Learning to embrace the girl I used to be—
      Yeah, I’m choosing me.</p>
  
      <p>[Bridge]
      I’m not closing any doors, just opening my own,
      Learning I can walk a little farther on my own.
      Got a little stronger, got a little light—
      And I’m holding onto what feels right.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]
      I’m finally breathing, letting my soul shine,
      Finding pieces of myself I left behind,
      I’m choosing me tonight.
      (I’m choosing me tonight.)
      No hard feelings, just a little more peace,
      Learning to embrace the girl I used to be—
      Yeah, I’m choosing me tonight.
      I’m choosing me.</p>
  
      <p>[Outro]
      We’re moving on, and maybe that’s alright,
      Two honest hearts stepping into new light.
      No hard feelings, just a quiet release—
      And we’re both finding our own kind of peace.</p>

      <p>[Intro]
      We try so hard, but sometimes love just fades,
      Two honest hearts walking different ways.
      No hard feelings, just a quiet truth—
      Lost in silence, trying to find our way through.</p>
  
      <p>[Verse 1]
      I’m sitting right beside you,
      but you feel so far away.
      Your eyes are somewhere distant,
      like you’re fading more each day.
      We used to talk forever,
      about all our plans and dreams.
      Now we barely talk at all,
      and neither one of us feels seen.</p>
  
      <p>[Pre Chorus]
      I see the way you’re hurting.
      Even when you look away.
      I want to reach out and hold you,
      but I just don’t know what to say.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]
      Never heard silence quite so loud.
      Both wanting change,
      Both needing more,
      Both feeling something we can’t ignore.
      Never heard silence quite so loud.
      Both losing ground,
      Both breaking down,
      Neither wants to be the first to say— goodbye.</p>
  
      <p>[Verse 2]
      I can see you pulling away,
      and I’m not proud of who I’ve been.
      I want to reach out and hold you,
      but I know it’d break me again.
      I miss the nights we’d talk for hours,
      like nothing could pull us apart.
      Now when I try to reach you,
      I can’t find my way to your heart.</p>
  
      <p>[Pre Chorus]
      I’m trying not to blame you,
      for the words you never said,
      but the absence in your eyes,
      says you’re letting go instead.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]
      Never heard silence quite so loud.
      Both wanting change,
      Both needing more,
      Both feeling something we can’t ignore.
      Never heard silence quite so loud.
      Both losing ground,
      Both breaking for the last time,
      So we finally say— goodbye.</p>
      
      <p>[Outro]
      We’re moving on, and maybe that’s alright,
      Two honest hearts stepping into new light.
      No hard feelings, just a quiet release—
      And we’re both finding our own kind of peace.</p>

    lyrics_html: |
      <p>[Verse]
      You say the world is a place to explore,
      You get a thrill from the race and the roar.
      Then you’re in it,
      We’re so in it…
      Then suddenly you leave—
      A summer you swore you’d never forget,
      When fall comes around, you don’t feel it yet.
      How do I take that?
      I’m so displaced now,
      When you leave me.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]
      You know
      I can't see all around the world
      Can't see all around the world without you
      (All around the world)
      Can't see all around the world
      You know
      I can't see all around the world
      Can't see all around the world without you
      (All around the world)
      Can't see all around the world</p>
  
      <p>[Verse]
      I have a routine when I put on my face,
      Try to cover it up so I don’t look the same.
      Then it’s foundation,
      Eyes,
      Lips…
      Then I’m brand new.
      But you show up saying, “Hey,
      I’ve got someone in mind for you today —
      The one you think of
      All of the time,
      Who would take you out,
      Who would treat you right…
      The way he should.”</p>
  
      <p>[Bridge]
      Maybe I was chasing you too far,
      Running circles ’round your shooting star.
      But every place you showed me how to see
      Is still a map that leads me back to me.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]
      You know
      I can see all around the world,
      But it’s different than it was with you.
      (All around the world)
      I’m learning what is true.
      You know
      I can see all around the world,
      Even if I miss the view I knew.
      (All around the world)
      I’m finding something new.</p>
  
      <p>[Outro]
      All around the world…
      I’m still moving.
      All around the world…
      I’m still choosing.
      All around the world…
      I’m finding me.</p>

      <p><strong>Official audio for “After the Silence” by Horizon Sound.</strong></p>
  
      <p>“After the Silence” is a calm, reflective emotional pop ballad shaped by warm expressive female vocals, soft piano, warm strings, airy pads, and gentle drums. It carries the quiet strength that follows a long storm — the moment when the noise fades, the dust settles, and healing finally has room to breathe.</p>
  
      <p>The song follows a woman standing in the stillness left behind after heartbreak. She traces the cracks, acknowledges the wreckage, and slowly discovers a softer, steadier version of herself emerging in the quiet. “After the Silence” captures the slow rise of hope, the courage to trust again, and the quiet power of rebuilding from the inside out.</p>

    lyrics_html: |
      <p>[Verse 1]<br>
      The storm has finally faded,<br>
      Left a quiet in its wake.<br>
      All the words we left unspoken<br>
      Start to rise and resonate.<br>
      Now I’m standing in the stillness<br>
      Where the wreckage used to be —<br>
      And in the space you left behind,<br>
      I feel a softer part of me.</p>
  
      <p>[Pre‑Chorus]<br>
      I’ve been learning how to breathe again<br>
      In a world that doesn’t feel the same.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]<br>
      After the silence…<br>
      I can hear my heartbeat steady for the first time in a while.<br>
      There’s a softness in the quiet that I never thought I’d find again.<br>
      After the silence…<br>
      I’m not who I was before I fell,<br>
      But I’m stronger than the pieces of it all.<br>
      And I’m finally finding light again…<br>
      After the silence.</p>
  
      <p>[Verse 2]<br>
      I trace the cracks along the walls —<br>
      Every fracture tells the truth.<br>
      I was trying to hold my world together<br>
      Even though I was breaking inside.<br>
      But now the calm is settling<br>
      Like a blanket on my skin —<br>
      And in the quiet of this moment,<br>
      I feel something new begin.</p>
  
      <p>[Pre‑Chorus]<br>
      I’m still learning how to trust myself,<br>
      But I’m standing on my own.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]<br>
      After the silence…<br>
      I can hear my heartbeat steady for the first time in a while.<br>
      There’s a softness in the quiet that I never thought I’d find again.<br>
      After the silence…<br>
      I’m not who I was before I fell,<br>
      But I’m stronger than the pieces of it all.<br>
      And I’m finally finding light again…<br>
      After the silence.</p>
  
      <p>[Bridge]<br>
      Maybe healing isn’t sudden,<br>
      Maybe peace is slow to rise.<br>
      Maybe strength is just the courage<br>
      To sit with what survived.<br>
      But in the hush that fills this room,<br>
      In the calm that meets my eyes —<br>
      I feel the world returning<br>
      One small breath at a time.</p>
  
      <p>[Final Chorus]<br>
      After the silence…<br>
      I can hear my own voice calling from a place I thought was gone.<br>
      There’s a warmth inside the quiet where the hurt can’t linger on.<br>
      I’m not who I was before I fell,<br>
      But I’m learning I don’t need to be.<br>
      And I’m finally stepping into light again…<br>
      After the silence.</p>
  
      <p>[Outro]<br>
      The quiet feels unfamiliar…<br>
      But it’s starting to feel like mine.</p>

      <p>[Intro]<br>
      One light left on the stage…<br>
      Still shining where you used to stand</p>
  
      <p>[Verse 1]<br>
      I walk across these worn‑out floorboards,<br>
      Feel the echo of your soul.<br>
      Every word you ever whispered<br>
      Still hangs heavy in the cold.<br>
      I keep the bulb burning softly —<br>
      It’s a promise I can’t shake.<br>
      A little glow for all the moments<br>
      That the darkness couldn’t take.</p>
  
      <p>[Pre‑Chorus]<br>
      My mind knows you’re gone, but<br>
      My heart still feels you waiting in the wings.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]<br>
      You’re my ghostlight —<br>
      The little flame I leave on when the world slips into night.<br>
      A quiet glow that illuminates the space<br>
      Where your memory still fills the place.<br>
      I know you won’t be walking in,<br>
      But I can’t let the darkness win.<br>
      So I keep it burning bright…<br>
      My ghostlight.</p>
  
      <p>[Verse 2]<br>
      I’ve tried to close the curtains slowly,<br>
      Tried to sweep this stage of you.<br>
      But the dust keeps rising softly,<br>
      Tracing all we couldn’t do.<br>
      And though the seats are cold and empty,<br>
      I replay the lines we wrote —<br>
      Every laugh and every heartbreak<br>
      Still rehearsed in every note.</p>
  
      <p>[Pre‑Chorus]<br>
      I know the show is over,<br>
      But I can’t dim what still remains.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]<br>
      You’re my ghostlight —<br>
      The little flame I leave on when the world slips into night.<br>
      A quiet glow that illuminates the space<br>
      Where your memory still fills this place.<br>
      I know you won’t be walking in,<br>
      But I can’t let the darkness win.<br>
      So I keep it burning bright…<br>
      My ghostlight.</p>
  
      <p>[Bridge]<br>
      Maybe someday I’ll switch it off<br>
      And let the shadows have their turn.<br>
      Maybe someday I’ll walk away<br>
      From all the things that still burn.<br>
      But tonight I need the comfort<br>
      Of the glow you left behind —<br>
      A single light to guide me<br>
      Through all the corners of my mind.</p>
  
      <p>[Final Chorus]<br>
      You’re my ghostlight —<br>
      Still shining brightly while I’m learning to be alright.<br>
      A quiet flame that anchors this place<br>
      Where I loved you more than time or space.<br>
      I can feel you won’t be back again,<br>
      But letting go takes strength I still don’t have<br>
      So I’ll keep it burning bright…<br>
      My ghostlight.</p>
  
      <p>[Outro]<br>
      One light left on the stage…<br>
      Waiting for the day I’m ready to let go.</p>

      <p><strong>Official audio for “If You’d Asked” by Horizon Sound.</strong></p>
  
      <p>“If You’d Asked” is a slow, aching emotional pop ballad shaped by warm expressive female vocals, soft piano, warm strings, subtle drums, and spacious reverb. It carries the weight of regret — the heartbreak of a love that ended not with a fight, but with silence.</p>
  
      <p>The song tells the story of someone who would have stayed, fought, rebuilt, and tried again… if only the other person had asked. She had answers ready for questions that never came, hope ready for a chance that never arrived. Instead, the door closed quietly, leaving her with all the words she never got to say. “If You’d Asked” captures the pain of unspoken love and the ache of a goodbye that didn’t have to happen.</p>

      <p>[Intro]<br>
      I keep replaying the moment<br>
      When you let go without a word</p>
  
      <p>[Verse 1]<br>
      You said you didn’t want to hurt me,<br>
      So you walked away instead.<br>
      You left the questions on the table,<br>
      And the words you left unsaid.<br>
      I was waiting for a reason,<br>
      For a sign you’d change your mind —<br>
      But you never turned around,<br>
      Never gave us one more try.</p>
  
      <p>[Pre‑Chorus]<br>
      And I wonder if you ever knew<br>
      How close I was to choosing you.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]<br>
      If you’d asked…<br>
      I would’ve stayed,<br>
      I would’ve fought, I would’ve held you through the fall.<br>
      If you’d asked…<br>
      I would’ve tried to change, tried to bring the fire back.<br>
      But you never said a word,<br>
      Never let me heal the hurt.<br>
      You just left me in the past…<br>
      If only you’d asked.</p>
  
      <p>[Verse 2]<br>
      I rehearsed all the answers<br>
      To the questions you never asked.<br>
      I was ready for the hard work,<br>
      To rebuild what we had.<br>
      But you made the choice in silence,<br>
      Closed the door without a sound —<br>
      And the stillness in that moment<br>
      Told me you were truly gone.</p>
  
      <p>[Pre‑Chorus]<br>
      And I wonder if you ever knew<br>
      How close I was to choosing you.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]<br>
      If you’d asked…<br>
      I would’ve stayed,<br>
      I would’ve fought, I would’ve held you through the fall.<br>
      If you’d asked…<br>
      I would’ve tried to change, tried to bring the fire back.<br>
      But you never said a word,<br>
      Never let me heal the hurt.<br>
      You just left me in the past…<br>
      If only you’d asked.</p>
  
      <p>[Bridge]<br>
      Maybe you were afraid to need me,<br>
      Maybe your pride got in the way.<br>
      Maybe loving me was too much,<br>
      More than you could ever say.<br>
      But I would’ve carried it all,<br>
      If you’d only let me try —<br>
      You’ll never know a time<br>
      Where we didn’t say goodbye.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]<br>
      If you’d asked…<br>
      I would’ve stayed, I would’ve fought, I would’ve held you through the cracks.<br>
      If you’d asked…<br>
      I would’ve changed the things you needed, tried to bring the fire back.<br>
      But you never said a word,<br>
      Never let me heal the hurt.<br>
      Now I’m learning to let go at last…<br>
      Of what we lost<br>
      When you never asked.</p>
  
      <p>[Outro]<br>
      You never asked…<br>
      So I walked away…</p>

      <p><strong>Official audio for “Half of Me” by Horizon Sound.</strong></p>
  
      <p>“Half of Me” is an empowering emotional pop ballad built on warm expressive female vocals, bold piano, rising strings, steady drums, and a cinematic lift that grows stronger with every chorus. It’s a self‑reclaiming anthem — the moment someone stops shrinking themselves to fit inside someone else’s expectations.</p>
  
      <p>The song follows a woman who softened her edges, quieted her voice, and reshaped herself to keep a love that never saw her fully. She bent until she broke, losing the person she used to be. But as she rebuilds, she discovers the fire she buried deep inside — the part of her that refuses to stay small. “Half of Me” is the sound of taking back space, rediscovering strength, and choosing authenticity over approval.</p>

      🎤 <strong>Vocals:</strong> warm female lead, expressive phrasing, powerful lift<br>
      🎛️ <strong>Production:</strong> piano, warm strings, steady drums, cinematic rise<br>

    lyrics_html: |
      <p>[Intro]<br>
      I sacrificed my edges<br>
      Just to fit inside your lines</p>
  
      <p>[Verse 1]<br>
      I molded myself to you,<br>
      Softened every part you touched.<br>
      Tried to be the calm you needed,<br>
      Even when it hurt too much.<br>
      I forgot the sound of laughter,<br>
      Lost the person I used to be —<br>
      Till the mirror showed a stranger<br>
      Who was tired of holding on.</p>
  
      <p>[Pre‑Chorus]<br>
      But something in me is waking,<br>
      The version I long to be.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]<br>
      You only ever loved half of me —<br>
      The part that bent so you could breathe.<br>
      But now I’m finding in me what you couldn’t see,<br>
      The fire I buried deep inside.<br>
      I’m taking back the space I need,<br>
      No longer shrinking just to make you feel strong.<br>
      I’m done being who you wanted me to be…<br>
      You only loved half of me.</p>
  
      <p>[Verse 2]<br>
      I used to fear the quiet moments,<br>
      It’s when I replayed all my hurt.<br>
      But now I see my own reflection,<br>
      Feel the beating of my heart.<br>
      I’m rebuilding all the pieces<br>
      That crumbled when I tried to stay —<br>
      And the woman I’m becoming<br>
      Would be the first to walk away.</p>
  
      <p>[Pre‑Chorus]<br>
      My power’s coming from breaking,<br>
      From choosing who I am at last.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]<br>
      You only ever loved half of me —<br>
      The part that bent so you could breathe.<br>
      But now I’m finding in me what you couldn’t see,<br>
      The fire I buried deep inside.<br>
      I’m taking back the space I need,<br>
      No longer shrinking just to make you feel strong.<br>
      I’m done being who you wanted me to be…<br>
      You only loved half of me.</p>
  
      <p>[Bridge]<br>
      So I’m done apologizing<br>
      For the parts you couldn’t see.<br>
      I’m done with being quiet<br>
      Just to fit inside your lines.<br>
      I’m rising slow and steady<br>
      Into who I’m meant to be —</p>
  
      <p>[Final Chorus]<br>
      You only ever loved half of me —<br>
      But now I’m embracing all the things<br>
      you never let me be.<br>
      Now I’m shining fearlessly,<br>
      A brighter, bolder melody.<br>
      I’m taking back the space I need,<br>
      No longer shrinking just to make you feel strong.<br>
      I’m finally who I’m meant to be…<br>
      And you can’t have half of me.</p>
  
      <p>[Outro]<br>
      I’m whole again…<br>
      And I will never turn back.</p>

      <p><strong>Official audio for “Paper Walls” by Horizon Sound.</strong></p>
  
      <p>“Paper Walls” is a vulnerable emotional pop ballad built around warm expressive female vocals, soft piano, warm strings, airy pads, and a gentle cinematic rise. The song begins in fragile whispers and slowly expands into a soaring, cathartic chorus — the sound of someone finally admitting how breakable they’ve always been beneath the armor.</p>
  
      <p>The story follows a woman who tried to hide her fears, doubts, and softness behind carefully constructed walls. She painted strength over every crack, hoping no one would see how easily she could fall apart. But one touch, one word, one moment of real connection was enough to reveal the truth she’d been trying to bury. “Paper Walls” captures the moment she realizes that vulnerability isn’t weakness — it’s the beginning of being truly seen.</p>

    lyrics_html: |
      <p>[Intro]<br>
      I built them up so carefully…<br>
      But they never stood a chance</p>
  
      <p>[Verse 1]<br>
      I filled every crack with hope,<br>
      Painted strength on every side.<br>
      Told the world I didn’t need you,<br>
      Held my breath and hoped they’d see<br>
      All the armor I’d imagined,<br>
      All the lies I tried to sell —<br>
      But the truth was in the trembling<br>
      Every time you met my eyes.</p>
  
      <p>[Pre‑Chorus]<br>
      One word and I was breaking,<br>
      One touch and I came undone.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]<br>
      ’Cause these paper walls<br>
      Look strong until you lean on them at all.<br>
      One breath, and they fall apart,<br>
      Scattering the pieces of my guarded heart.<br>
      I tried so hard to stand up tall,<br>
      But I was never built to bear that weight.<br>
      You saw right through it all…<br>
      My paper walls.</p>
  
      <p>[Verse 2]<br>
      I tucked away each fear so neatly,<br>
      Stacked them where you couldn’t see.<br>
      Thought if I could hide the fragile,<br>
      You might stay a while with me.<br>
      But the rain kept seeping in,<br>
      Through the layers of my doubt —<br>
      And the moment that you touched me,<br>
      All the truth came pouring out.</p>
  
      <p>[Pre‑Chorus]<br>
      One look and I was shaking,<br>
      One sigh and I came undone.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]<br>
      ’Cause these paper walls<br>
      Look strong until you lean on them at all.<br>
      One breath, and they fall apart,<br>
      Scattering the pieces of my guarded heart.<br>
      I tried so hard to stand up tall,<br>
      But I was never built to bear that weight.<br>
      You saw right through it all…<br>
      My paper walls.</p>
  
      <p>[Bridge]<br>
      Maybe I was scared to show<br>
      The softness deep inside.<br>
      Maybe I believed that love<br>
      Was something I’d be denied.<br>
      But you held the broken pieces<br>
      Like they mattered after all —<br>
      And I learned that even when I’m fragile<br>
      I can stand when you’re by my side.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]<br>
      These paper walls<br>
      Aren’t meant to keep out every rise and fall.<br>
      I’m learning not to fear the cracks,<br>
      Let the light shine through the places I’ve held back.<br>
      I don’t need to stand up tall —<br>
      Not when I have someone<br>
      to lean on through it all.<br>
      You helped me see beyond<br>
      My paper walls.</p>
  
      <p>[Outro]<br>
      I’m stronger now…<br>
      Because I let them fall.</p>

      <p><strong>Official audio for “The Way We Lied” by Horizon Sound.</strong></p>
  
      <p>“The Way We Lied” is a slow, aching emotional pop ballad shaped by warm expressive female vocals, soft piano, warm strings, and spacious reverb. It captures the heavy truth of a love that faded long before either person was willing to admit it — a relationship held together by hope, denial, and silence.</p>
  
      <p>The song follows two people pretending they’re still okay, painting over cracks, brushing aside tears, and calling heartbreak “just a bruise.” The real truth sits in the quiet moments — the distance at the table, the promises neither of them believes anymore. It’s a confession of the ways we cling to something already slipping away, and the pain of finally facing what’s been true all along.</p>
  
      <p>🎧 <strong>Vibe:</strong> slow, heavy, emotional<br>
      🎤 <strong>Vocals:</strong> warm female lead, rich tone, intimate delivery<br>
      🎛️ <strong>Production:</strong> soft piano, warm strings, light drums, atmospheric reverb<br>
      ⚡ <strong>Mood:</strong> aching, reflective, quietly devastating</p>

      <p>[INTRO]<br>
      We said we were alright…<br>
      Even when the truth was breaking</p>
  
      <p>[VERSE 1]<br>
      We told ourselves the fire lingered,<br>
      Even when the embers died.<br>
      We held hands like perfect strangers<br>
      Trying hard to justify<br>
      Every silence at the table,<br>
      Every tear we brushed aside —<br>
      Calling distance “just a rough patch,”<br>
      Calling heartbreak “just a bruise.”</p>
  
      <p>[PRE‑CHORUS]<br>
      But the truth was in the silence,<br>
      In the things we didn’t say.</p>
  
      <p>[CHORUS]<br>
      That’s the way we lied —<br>
      Saying anything to keep a fading love alive.<br>
      Convincing ourselves that we were fine,<br>
      When we both knew we were running out of time.<br>
      We painted over every crack,<br>
      Pretending we could find our way back.<br>
      But we were breaking from inside…<br>
      That’s the way we lied.</p>
  
      <p>[VERSE 2]<br>
      We told ourselves we’d fix it later,<br>
      But later never came.<br>
      We held on to fading moments,<br>
      Watching as each one slipped away.<br>
      You said you’d try harder,<br>
      I said I’d learn to bend —<br>
      But we both knew we’d stopped believing<br>
      Long before we reached this end.</p>
  
      <p>[PRE‑CHORUS]<br>
      And the truth kept getting louder<br>
      Slowly drowning out the lies.</p>
  
      <p>[CHORUS]<br>
      That’s the way we lied —<br>
      Saying anything to keep a fading love alive.<br>
      Convincing ourselves that we were fine,<br>
      When we both knew we were running out of time.<br>
      We painted over every crack,<br>
      Pretending we could find our way back.<br>
      But we were breaking from inside…<br>
      That’s the way we lied.</p>
  
      <p>[BRIDGE]<br>
      Maybe we were scared to see<br>
      The life we built was gone.<br>
      Maybe loving you meant staying<br>
      Long after our hearts moved on.<br>
      And maybe truth cut far too deep<br>
      For hearts already worn.</p>
  
      <p>[CHORUS]<br>
      That’s the way we lied —<br>
      Saying anything to keep a fading love alive.<br>
      Convincing ourselves that we were fine,<br>
      When we both knew we were running out of time.<br>
      We painted over every crack,<br>
      Pretending we could find our way back.<br>
      But we were breaking from inside…<br>
      That’s the way we lied.</p>
  
      <p>[OUTRO]<br>
      We said we were alright…<br>
      But we never were.</p>

      <p><strong>Official audio for “Homesick for You” by Horizon Sound.</strong></p>
  
      <p>“Homesick for You” is a soft, reflective emotional pop ballad built around gentle piano, warm pads, subtle strings, and a spacious, nostalgic atmosphere. The warm expressive female vocal brings a tender ache to the story — not longing for a lost love, but longing for the version of herself she became when she felt safe.</p>
  
      <p>The song explores the quiet grief of losing the person you were in a relationship that once felt like home. She isn’t missing the romance or the heartbreak — she’s missing the softness, the bravery, the lightness she carried back then. It’s a search for the self she left behind, and a hope that she can find her way back to that version of herself again.</p>

      <p>[INTRO]<br>
      I miss a place I can’t return to…<br>
      A version of myself I was with you.</p>
  
      <p>[VERSE 1]<br>
      There was a light inside my laughter,<br>
      A softness in the way I breathed.<br>
      You held the parts I hid from others,<br>
      Made the broken feel complete.<br>
      Now I’m going through my memories,<br>
      Trying hard to find that girl —<br>
      But she’s somewhere in the distance,<br>
      In a long‑forgotten world.</p>
  
      <p>[PRE‑CHORUS]<br>
      I don’t miss the way we ended…<br>
      I miss who I was back then.</p>
  
      <p>[CHORUS]<br>
      I’m homesick for you —<br>
      Not the love, not the hurt, but the me I used to be.<br>
      Homesick for the way<br>
      I felt safe enough to let my armor fall.<br>
      I’m not longing for your arms,<br>
      Just the calm before the storms.<br>
      I’m missing who I grew into…<br>
      I’m homesick for you.</p>
  
      <p>[VERSE 2]<br>
      I try to find her in the mirror,<br>
      But her smile doesn’t look like mine.<br>
      She was softer, she was braver,<br>
      She believed in brighter times.<br>
      Now I’m trying hard to reach her,<br>
      Trying to bring her back again —<br>
      But it’s hard to find the pieces<br>
      When you don’t know where they went.</p>
  
      <p>[PRE‑CHORUS]<br>
      I don’t need the past to save me…<br>
      I just want to recognize myself again.</p>
  
      <p>[CHORUS]<br>
      I’m homesick for you —<br>
      Not the love, not the hurt, but the me I used to be.<br>
      Homesick for the way<br>
      I felt safe enough to let my armor fall.<br>
      I’m not longing for your arms,<br>
      Just the calm before the storms.<br>
      I’m missing who I grew into…<br>
      I’m homesick for you.</p>
  
      <p>[BRIDGE]<br>
      Maybe I’ve always been her,<br>
      Just shining in the light you gave.<br>
      Maybe I can bring her back<br>
      Without retracing every ache.<br>
      Maybe healing isn’t finding you —<br>
      It’s finding me again<br>
      In all the places I hid.</p>
  
      <p>[CHORUS]<br>
      I’m homesick for you —<br>
      Not the love, not the hurt, but the me I used to be.<br>

      <p><strong>Official audio for “Borrowed Time” by Horizon Sound.</strong></p>
  
      <p>“Borrowed Time” is a tender, mid‑tempo emotional pop ballad shaped by warm expressive female vocals, soft piano, gentle strings, and a nostalgic cinematic glow. It carries a bittersweet rise, balancing tenderness with the ache of knowing something beautiful was never meant to last.</p>
  
      <p>The song tells the story of loving someone you always knew you couldn’t keep. Every moment felt temporary, every kiss a small miracle borrowed from a future where the ending was already written. She holds on anyway — choosing fleeting warmth over emptiness — even as she feels the distance growing. It’s a confession of loving in the shadows of inevitability, and cherishing the seconds that were never really hers.</p>

      <p>[INTRO]<br>
      I always knew the clock was ticking,<br>
      But I held on to the moment anyway.</p>
  
      <p>[VERSE 1]<br>
      You were sunlight in the winter,<br>
      Warmth I never thought I’d feel.<br>
      Every touch was temporary,<br>
      But it all felt so unreal.<br>
      I could see the ending coming,<br>
      Like a shadow on the floor —<br>
      Still I held you like a secret<br>
      I’d be foolish to ignore.</p>
  
      <p>[PRE‑CHORUS]<br>
      I knew the ending waited,<br>
      Somewhere just beyond your smile.</p>
  
      <p>[CHORUS]<br>
      We were living on borrowed time —<br>
      Holding on to seconds that were never really mine.<br>
      Every kiss, every night,<br>
      Was a moment I kept stealing from the light.<br>
      I knew someday you’d draw the line,<br>
      But I stayed anyway, pretending you were mine.<br>
      Love that wasn’t built to last…<br>
      Still felt worth the borrowed time.</p>
  
      <p>[VERSE 2]<br>
      You were always half a promise,<br>
      Half a dream I couldn’t keep.<br>
      But I chose the fleeting magic<br>
      Over nights of dreamless sleep.<br>
      I could feel you drifting slowly,<br>
      Like a tide that won’t return —<br>
      But I held on to the embers<br>
      Just to feel a little burn.</p>
  
      <p>[PRE‑CHORUS]<br>
      I knew the ending was coming,<br>
      But I held on to what we had.</p>
  
      <p>[CHORUS]<br>
      We were living on borrowed time —<br>
      Holding on to seconds that were never really mine.<br>
      Every kiss, every night,<br>
      Was a moment I kept stealing from the light.<br>
      I knew someday you’d draw the line,<br>
      But I stayed anyway, pretending you were mine.<br>
      Love that wasn’t built to last…<br>
      Still felt worth the borrowed time.</p>
  
      <p>[BRIDGE]<br>
      Maybe loving you was choosing<br>
      Beauty over what was true.<br>
      Maybe I was meant to lose you<br>
      Just to learn what love can do.<br>
      And though the ending still reminds me<br>
      How the sweetest things can fade —<br>
      I don’t regret a single heartbeat<br>
      Of the moments that we made.</p>
  
      <p>[CHORUS]<br>
      We were living on borrowed time —<br>
      And I’d do it all again just to feel your hand in mine.<br>
      Every kiss, every night,<br>
      Was a spark that made the darkness feel like light.<br>
      I knew someday you’d draw the line,<br>
      But I stayed anyway, pretending you were mine.<br>
      Some loves only last a while…<br>
      But they’re worth the borrowed time.</p>
  
      <p>[OUTRO]<br>
      I always knew the clock was ticking…<br>
      But I loved you while I could.</p>

      <p><strong>Official audio for “The Quiet After” by Horizon Sound.</strong></p>
  
      <p>“The Quiet After” is a slow, cinematic pop‑soul ballad built around warm expressive female vocals, intimate close‑mic delivery, and a soft, resonant piano at the center. Gentle strings, subtle drums, and spacious reverb create a heartbreak‑after‑the‑storm atmosphere — the kind of quiet that feels heavier than the chaos that came before it.</p>
  
      <p>The song follows someone standing in the aftermath of a love that’s finally burned out. The shouting is gone, the fire has faded, and what remains is the painful clarity of silence. She walks through rooms still holding traces of what used to be — a coat by the door, a cup on the counter — realizing that the quiet things now feel louder than the love they lost. As she picks up the pieces, she begins the slow process of learning how to live again.</p>

      <p>[INTRO]<br>
      I still hear the whisper of your voice.<br>
      But the quiet’s closing in on me.</p>
  
      <p>[VERSE 1]<br>
      We used to fill these rooms with passion<br>
      Every touch a spark that roared.<br>
      Now I’m walking through the silence<br>
      Where love won’t burn like once before.<br>
      There’s a cup still on the counter<br>
      Your coat hanging by the door.<br>
      Funny how the quiet things<br>
      Feel louder than before.</p>
  
      <p>[PRE‑CHORUS]<br>
      I thought the storm would break me<br>
      But it’s the calm that hurts the most.</p>
  
      <p>[CHORUS]<br>
      This is the quiet after —<br>
      When the shouting fades and the truth rings louder.<br>
      When the tears run dry and the nights grow colder,<br>
      And the weight of what we were<br>
      Falls heavy on our shoulders.<br>
      No more fire, no more passion…<br>
      Just me, picking up the pieces<br>
      In the quiet after.</p>
  
      <p>[VERSE 2]<br>
      I keep reliving every moment<br>
      Trying to see what I ignored.<br>
      All the warnings in your actions<br>
      All the distance you explored.<br>
      Now the silence feels like prison<br>
      A sentence I can’t appeal.<br>
      I never knew that losing you<br>
      Would be the ache I couldn’t heal.</p>
  
      <p>[PRE‑CHORUS]<br>
      I thought our love would save us,<br>
      But nothing could have braced me for the pain.</p>
  
      <p>[CHORUS]<br>
      This is the quiet after —<br>
      When the shouting fades and the truth rings louder.<br>
      When the tears run dry and the nights grow colder,<br>
      And the weight of what we were<br>
      Falls heavy on our shoulders.<br>
      No more fire, no more passion…<br>
      Just me, picking up the pieces<br>
      In the quiet after.</p>
  
      <p>[BRIDGE]<br>
      Maybe someday I’ll forgive us<br>
      For the words we never said.<br>
      For the love we couldn’t mend,<br>
      For the dreams we left for dead.<br>
      But tonight I’m stuck between us,<br>
      In the space you used to be —<br>
      Trying to breathe inside the silence<br>
      In a pain that keeps its hold on me.</p>
  
      <p>[CHORUS]<br>
      This is the quiet after —<br>
      When the shouting fades and the truth rings louder.<br>
      When the tears run dry and the nights grow colder,<br>
      And the weight of what we were<br>
      Falls heavy on our shoulders.<br>
      No more fire, no more passion…<br>
      Just me, picking up the pieces<br>
      In the quiet after.<br>
      And learning how to live again.</p>
  
      <p>[OUTRO]<br>
      The room no longer holds your memory,<br>
      And I’m learning how to stand here on my own.</p>

      <p><strong>Official audio for “Already Out the Door” by Horizon Sound.</strong></p>
  
      <p>“Already Out the Door” is a modern country heartbreak story built on warm acoustic guitars, steady mid‑tempo drums, and clean Nashville‑style electric fills. An emotional male lead vocal carries the song with sincerity and restraint, avoiding exaggerated twang while leaning into a wounded, reflective tone. Smooth harmonies bloom only in the chorus, adding lift without overshadowing the intimacy of the verses. The production is polished, spacious, and subtly atmospheric, letting the storytelling take center stage.</p>
  
      <p>This song captures the quiet devastation of realizing trust is gone — the late‑night waiting, the phone location that tells the truth, and the moment a relationship breaks without a single raised voice. Honest, grounded, and deeply human, “Already Out the Door” is a modern country confession for anyone who’s stayed too long, hoped too hard, and finally walked away with nothing left to give.</p>
  
      <p>🎧 <strong>Vibe:</strong> modern country, mid‑tempo, emotional, reflective<br>
      🎤 <strong>Vocals:</strong> sincere male lead, warm tone, soft harmonies in the chorus<br>
      🎛️ <strong>Production:</strong> acoustic‑driven, subtle electric fills, clean Nashville mix<br>
      ⚡ <strong>Mood:</strong> wounded, resigned, honest, quietly powerful</p>

      <p>[Verse 1]<br>
      You said you were out with the girls,<br>
      but your dot never left his street.<br>
      I waited up hopin’ I was wrong,<br>
      but the map don’t lie…<br>
      the way you lied to me.</p>
  
      <p>[Pre‑Chorus]<br>
      You’ve said "baby, I swear" so many times,<br>
      you made the truth into somethin’ I don’t recognize.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]<br>
      You say you’re tellin’ the truth,<br>
      but I’ve heard that line before.<br>
      Your phone said you were with him,<br>
      while I sat here waiting by the door.<br>
      Maybe you mean it tonight…<br>
      but I can’t trust you anymore.<br>
      It hurts when the proof shows up<br>
      in all the places you tried to hide.<br>
      Yeah, maybe you’re honest tonight…<br>
      but I’m already out the door.</p>
  
      <p>[Verse 2]<br>
      I remember when your word meant somethin’,<br>
      back before the cracks started showin’ through.<br>
      Now every promise feels borrowed,<br>
      and every answer sounds rehearsed instead of true.<br>
      You say tonight you’re bein’ honest,<br>
      but I heard that tremble in your voice.<br>
      And even if you’re tellin’ the truth right now,<br>
      I just can’t believe you anymore.</p>
  
      <p>[Pre‑Chorus]<br>
      I’ve heard every promise you’ve ever made,<br>
      and every one just fades a little more with every word you speak.</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]<br>
      You say you’re tellin’ the truth,<br>
      but I’ve heard that line before.<br>
      Your phone said you were with him,<br>
      while I sat here waiting by the door.<br>
      Maybe you mean it tonight…<br>
      but I can’t trust you anymore.<br>
      It hurts when the proof shows up<br>
      in all the places you tried to hide.<br>
      Yeah, maybe you’re honest tonight…<br>
      but I’m already out the door.</p>
  
      <p>[Verse 3]<br>
      I’m standin’ here lookin’ at you<br>
      and I wish I felt somethin’ break inside.<br>
      But all the hurt already happened<br>
      and all the tears already dried.<br>
      You say tonight you’re tellin’ the truth,<br>
      and maybe for once that’s not wrong.<br>
      But trust don’t heal up overnight,<br>
      and mine’s been gone for far too long.</p>
  
      <p>[Bridge]<br>
      I shouldn’t have to check a map<br>
      to know where you’ve been.<br>
      If I can’t trust what you say,<br>
      how could we ever make this right?</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]<br>
      You say you’re tellin’ the truth,<br>
      but I’ve heard that line before.<br>
      Your phone said you were with him,<br>
      while I sat here waiting by the door.<br>
      Maybe you mean it tonight…<br>
      but I can’t trust you anymore.<br>
      It hurts when the proof shows up<br>
      in all the places you tried to hide.<br>
      Yeah, maybe you’re honest tonight…<br>
      but I’m already out the door.</p>
  
      <p>[Outro]<br>
      I’m already out the door.<br>
      Yeah, I’m already out the door…</p>
