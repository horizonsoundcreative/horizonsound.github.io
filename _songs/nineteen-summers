lyrics: |
  [Verse 1]
  She grew up on a quiet street,
  Bare feet on July concrete,
  Laughin’ with her friends ’til the porch lights blinked,
  Dreamin’ bigger than her little town.
  First kiss in a borrowed car,
  Heartbreak under midnight stars,
  She thought she had forever just to figure out
  What her life was all about.
  
  Then the headaches came like thunder,
  And the doctor’s voice went still.
  Six months written on a paper,
  That stripped her dreams away.
  
  [Pre‑Chorus]
  She cried for maybe half a day,
  Then wiped her tears and said, “Okay…
  If time is short, I’m gonna make it mine.”
  
  [Chorus]
  ’Cause she had nineteen summers
  And a heart that burned like fire,
  A list of dreams she’d folded
  In a notebook by her bedside.
  She said, “If I’m leaving early,
  Then I’m leaving something real.
  I don’t want to be forgotten
  Like I was never here.”
  But every life she touched
  Held her tighter in the end…
  And she learned she’d live forever
  In the hearts of all her friends.
  
  [Verse 2]
  She drove to see the ocean waves,
  Let the salt wind take her breath away,
  Screamed her name into the rising tide
  Just to hear the world scream back.
  She skydived from a clouded sky,
  Felt the rush of being truly alive,
  Bought a concert ticket to her favorite star
  And sang every line with a heart laid bare.
  
  But the hardest thing she ever did
  Was write those letters late at night—
  Words for when she wouldn’t be there,
  Pen trembling in the soft light.
  
  [Pre‑Chorus]
  She sealed them with a shaky hand,
  Said, “Promise me you’ll understand…
  I’m scared you’ll all forget me when I’m gone.”
  
  [Chorus]
  But she had nineteen summers
  And a love that didn’t fade,
  A laugh her mother carried
  Like a song she couldn’t shake.
  She said, “If I’m leaving early,
  Then I’m leaving something real.
  I don’t want to be forgotten
  Like I was never here.”
  But every tear they cried
  Was a story of who she’d been…
  And she learned she’d live forever
  In the hearts of all her friends.
  
  [Bridge]
  And on her final morning
  With the sunrise on her skin,
  She whispered, “I’m not frightened now…
  I know how this will end.”
  ’Cause every hand she held
  And every memory she made
  Was proof she’d never vanish
  When her heartbeat slipped away.
  
  [Chorus]
  She had nineteen summers
  But she filled them like a hundred,
  Turned six months into a lifetime
  With the courage that she carried.
  She said, “If I’m leaving early,
  Then I’m leaving something real.
  I don’t want to be forgotten
  Like I was never here.”
  But the love she left behind
  Was a flame that never dimmed…
  And she passed on knowing fully
  She would live through all of them.
  
  [Outro]
  Nineteen summers,
  But her story never ends.
  She’s a whisper in the ocean,
  She’s the love inside their hearts.
  And every life she touched
  Says her name now and again…
  So she lives on—
  In the hearts of all her friends.
