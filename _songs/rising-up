lyrics: |
  [VERSE 1]
  I’ve been walking through the shadows with my head down low,
  trying to find a little light on a long, dark road.
  Every step feels heavy like I’m dragging chains,
  but I’m done letting fear decide who I am.
  
  [PRE CHORUS]
  There’s a voice inside that won’t stay quiet,
  a flicker in the dark that starts a riot.
  Something in me rising through the silence,
  pulling me toward a fire starting to burn.
  
  [CHORUS]
  I’m stepping out of the dark that bound me,
  feeling light where the shadows used to be.
  I’m standing strong with the hope around me,
  every heartbeat steady, loud, and free.
  And when the night tries to pull me under,
  I’ll lift my voice and roll like thunder.
  I’m rising up — this is where I begin.
  
  [VERSE 2]
  I’ve been learning to breathe in a brand‑new way,
  letting go of all the weight that I held each day.
  There’s a fire in my chest that I can’t ignore,
  it’s lighting up a road I’m finally ready for.
  
  [PRE CHORUS]
  And every step I take feels a little brighter,
  the weight I carried now feels lighter.
  I’m finding pieces of a fighter
  I never knew were rising deep inside.
  
  [CHORUS]
  I’m stepping out of the dark that bound me,
  feeling light where the shadows used to be.
  I’m standing strong with the hope around me,
  every heartbeat steady, loud, and free.
  And when the night tries to pull me under,
  I’ll lift my voice and roll like thunder.
  I’m rising up — this is where I begin.
  
  [VERSE 3]
  Now I’m running with a heartbeat that won’t slow down,
  every mile I cross feels like sacred ground.
  I’m not the person that I used to be —
  I’m a storm breaking loose, I’m finally free.
  
  [BRIDGE]
  I’ve been held down, pushed down, torn apart,
  but I kept a little hope in the corner of my heart.
  Now I’m standing in the light of a brand‑new start,
  and I’m never going back to the dark.
  
  [CHORUS]
  I’m stepping out of the dark that bound me,
  feeling light where the shadows used to be.
  I’m standing strong with the hope around me,
  every heartbeat steady, loud, and free.
  And when the night tries to pull me under,
  I’ll lift my voice and roll like thunder.
  I’m rising up — this is where I begin.
  
  [Outro]
  I’m rising up…
  And I won’t fall again—
  And I won’t fall again—
  No, I won’t fall again—
