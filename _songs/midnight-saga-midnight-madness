  Official audio for "Midnight Madness" by Horizon Sound.
  
  “Midnight Madness” dives into the third chapter of The Midnight Saga with a hypnotic blend of pop, synth, and swirling late‑night energy. The track leans into the delirious, neon‑soaked middle of the night — where everything feels louder, brighter, and slightly unreal. With driving drums, glowing synth layers, and expressive female vocals, it captures the moment when the night fully takes over.
  
  This chapter follows the blur between excitement and overload. The verses drift through dizzy, dreamlike moments, while the chorus surges with the rush of being swept up in something bigger than yourself. “Midnight Madness” is the heart of the saga — the point where time dissolves, the world spins, and the night becomes its own universe.

lyrics: |
  [Intro]
  Release yourself 
  Reach for the sky
  
  [Verse 1]
  Neon on my skin, breathing in the night
  Laughing at the shadows that are flickering to life
  Didn’t plan the chaos, but it’s rising up my spine
  Something in the static says the night is mine
  
  [Pre Chorus]
  I feel the edges bending
  Don’t care who I’m offending
  I’m slipping but ascending
  And I don’t wanna stop
  
  [Chorus]
  Midnight madness, feeling the beat
  Losing my balance, but it feels so sweet
  Spinning like a tornado breaking loose
  I’m out of my mind and it feels so good
  Midnight madness, losing control
  The more I submit, the higher I go
  If this is a spiral, I’m riding it high
  I’m losing myself just to feel more alive
  
  [Verse 2]
  City’s breathing heavy trying to keep up with me
  A mirror in a window shows the girl I wanna be
  Running from the quiet, chasing every spark I see
  Every little flicker pulling me outside the lines
  
  [Pre Chorus]
  I feel the edges bending
  Don’t care who I’m offending
  I’m slipping but ascending
  And I don’t wanna stop
  
  [Chorus]
  Midnight madness, feeling the beat
  Losing my balance, but it feels so sweet
  Spinning like a tornado breaking loose
  I’m out of my mind and it feels so good
  Midnight madness, losing control
  The more I submit, the higher I go
  If this is a spiral, I’m riding it high
  I’m losing myself just to feel more alive
  
  [Bridge]
  Caught my reflection in the neon haze
  Didn’t recognize her, but I liked her face
  If this is unraveling, then let it unwind
  I’m not coming down, I’m leaving fear behind 
  
  [Chorus]
  Midnight madness, feeling the beat
  Losing my balance, but it feels so sweet
  Spinning like a tornado breaking loose
  I’m out of my mind and it feels so good
  Midnight madness, losing control
  The more I submit, the higher I go
  If this is a spiral, I’m riding it high
  I’m losing myself just to feel more alive
  
  [Outro]
  Feel the beat
  Feel alive
