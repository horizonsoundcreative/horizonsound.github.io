lyrics: |
  [Verse 1]
  I feel like I’m holding back the ocean,
  These storms behind my eyes.
  Telling everyone I’m fine,
  While the waves betray the lie.
  Every memory you left me
  Creates currents I can’t fight —
  And the more that I brace myself,
  The faster they arrive.
  
  [Pre Chorus]
  I try to breathe above it,
  But the truth keeps pulling me under.
  
  [Chorus]
  Saltwater falls again —
  Sliding down my cheeks like the sea spray in the wind.
  Saltwater, breaking free,
  Every tear a piece of what you meant to me.
  I can’t stop the flood within,
  But maybe letting go is how the healing finally begins.
  So let it rise, let it pour…
  Saltwater once more.
  
  [Verse 2]
  I’ve been drowning in the silence,
  In the words we never said.
  All the promises we whispered
  Now just echoes in my head.
  But there’s something in the letting go,
  A cleansing of the ache —
  Like the tide that steals the shoreline
  Just to give it back again.
  
  [Pre Chorus]
  I’m learning not to fight it,
  Let the waves wash over me.
  
  [Chorus]
  Saltwater falls again —
  Sliding down my cheeks like the sea spray in the wind.
  Saltwater, breaking free,
  Every tear a piece of what you meant to me.
  I can’t stop the flood within,
  But maybe letting go is how the healing finally begins.
  So let it rise, let it pour…
  Saltwater once more.
  
  [Bridge]
  Maybe I was meant to break
  So I could find the pieces worth saving.
  Maybe all this water’s just
  My way of finally changing.
  And when the tide recedes at last,
  I’ll see what’s left of me —
  A shoreline shaped by everything
  You ever meant to me.
  
  [Chorus]
  Saltwater falls again —
  But it’s softer now, a whisper where the pain had always been.
  Saltwater, setting free
  Every part of me that’s learning who I’m meant to be.
  I don’t fear the flood within,
  It’s the proof that I can rise from where I’ve been.
  Let it rise, let it pour…
  Saltwater no more.
  
  [Outro]
  The tide pulls back…
  And I remain.
