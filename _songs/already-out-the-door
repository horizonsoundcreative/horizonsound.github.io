  [Verse 1]
  You said you were out with the girls,
  but your dot never left his street.
  I waited up hopin’ I was wrong,
  but the map don’t lie…
  the way you lied to me.
  
  [Pre‑Chorus]
  You’ve said “baby, I swear” so many times,
  you made the truth into somethin’ I don’t recognize.
  
  [Chorus]
  You say you’re tellin’ the truth,
  but I’ve heard that line before.
  Your phone said you were with him,
  while I sat here waiting by the door.
  Maybe you mean it tonight…
  but I can’t trust you anymore.
  It hurts when the proof shows up
  in all the places you tried to hide.
  Yeah, maybe you’re honest tonight…
  but I’m already out the door.
  
  [Verse 2]
  I remember when your word meant somethin’,
  back before the cracks started showin’ through.
  Now every promise feels borrowed,
  and every answer sounds rehearsed instead of true.
  You say tonight you’re bein’ honest,
  but I heard that tremble in your voice.
  And even if you’re tellin’ the truth right now,
  I just can’t believe you anymore.
  
  [Pre-Chorus]
  I’ve heard every promise you’ve ever made,
  and every one just fades a little more with every word you speak.
  
  [Chorus]
  You say you’re tellin’ the truth,
  but I’ve heard that line before.
  Your phone said you were with him,
  while I sat here waiting by the door.
  Maybe you mean it tonight…
  but I can’t trust you anymore.
  It hurts when the proof shows up
  in all the places you tried to hide.
  Yeah, maybe you’re honest tonight…
  but I’m already out the door.
  
  [Verse 3]
  I’m standin’ here lookin’ at you
  and I wish I felt somethin’ break inside.
  But all the hurt already happened
  and all the tears already dried.
  You say tonight you’re tellin’ the truth,
  and maybe for once that’s not wrong.
  But trust don’t heal up overnight,
  and mine’s been gone for far too long.
  
  [Bridge]
  I shouldn’t have to check a map
  to know where you’ve been.
  If I can’t trust what you say,
  how could we ever make this right?
  
  [Chorus]
  You say you’re tellin’ the truth,
  but I’ve heard that line before.
  Your phone said you were with him,
  while I sat here waiting by the door.
  Maybe you mean it tonight…
  but I can’t trust you anymore.
  It hurts when the proof shows up
  in all the places you tried to hide.
  Yeah, maybe you’re honest tonight…
  but I’m already out the door.
  
  [Outro]
  I’m already out the door.
  Yeah, I’m already out the door…
