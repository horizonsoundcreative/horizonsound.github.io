  Official audio for “Paper Walls” by Horizon Sound.

  “Paper Walls” is a vulnerable emotional pop ballad built around warm expressive female vocals, soft piano, warm strings, airy pads, and a gentle cinematic rise. The song begins in fragile whispers and slowly expands into a soaring, cathartic chorus — the sound of someone finally admitting how breakable they’ve always been beneath the armor.
  
  The story follows a woman who tried to hide her fears, doubts, and softness behind carefully constructed walls. She painted strength over every crack, hoping no one would see how easily she could fall apart. But one touch, one word, one moment of real connection was enough to reveal the truth she’d been trying to bury. “Paper Walls” captures the moment she realizes that vulnerability isn’t weakness — it’s the beginning of being truly seen.

  🎤 Vocals: warm female lead, smooth vibrato, emotional phrasing

lyrics: |
  [Intro]
  I built them up so carefully…
  But they never stood a chance
  
  [Verse 1]
  I filled every crack with hope,
  Painted strength on every side.
  Told the world I didn’t need you,
  Held my breath and hoped they’d see
  All the armor I’d imagined,
  All the lies I tried to sell —
  But the truth was in the trembling
  Every time you met my eyes.
  
  [Pre-Chorus]
  One word and I was breaking,
  One touch and I came undone.
  
  [Chorus]
  ’Cause these paper walls
  Look strong until you lean on them at all.
  One breath, and they fall apart,
  Scattering the pieces of my guarded heart.
  I tried so hard to stand up tall,
  But I was never built to bear that weight.
  You saw right through it all…
  My paper walls.
  
  [Verse 2]
  I tucked away each fear so neatly,
  Stacked them where you couldn’t see.
  Thought if I could hide the fragile,
  You might stay a while with me.
  But the rain kept seeping in,
  Through the layers of my doubt —
  And the moment that you touched me,
  All the truth came pouring out.
  
  [Pre-Chorus]
  One look and I was shaking,
  One sigh and I came undone.
  
  [Chorus]
  ’Cause these paper walls
  Look strong until you lean on them at all.
  One breath, and they fall apart,
  Scattering the pieces of my guarded heart.
  I tried so hard to stand up tall,
  But I was never built to bear that weight.
  You saw right through it all…
  My paper walls.
  
  [Bridge] 
  Maybe I was scared to show 
  The softness deep inside. 
  Maybe I believed that love 
  Was something I’d be denied. 
  But you held the broken pieces 
  Like they mattered after all — 
  And I learned that even when I’m fragile
  I can stand when you’re by my side.
  
  [Chorus]
  These paper walls
  Aren’t meant to keep out every rise and fall.
  I’m learning not to fear the cracks,
  Let the light shine through the places I’ve held back.
  I don’t need to stand up tall —
  Not when I have someone 
  to lean on through it all.
  You helped me see beyond
  My paper walls.
  
  [Outro] 
  I’m stronger now…
  Because I let them fall.
