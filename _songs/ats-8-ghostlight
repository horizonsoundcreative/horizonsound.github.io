lyrics: |
  [Intro]
  One light left on the stage…
  Still shining where you used to stand
  
  [Verse 1]
  I walk across these worn‑out floorboards,
  Feel the echo of your soul.
  Every word you ever whispered
  Still hangs heavy in the cold.
  I keep the bulb burning softly —
  It’s a promise I can’t shake.
  A little glow for all the moments
  That the darkness couldn’t take.
  
  [Pre-Chorus]
  My mind knows you’re gone, but 
  My heart still feels you waiting in the wings.
  
  [Chorus]
  You’re my ghostlight —
  The little flame I leave on when the world slips into night.
  A quiet glow that illuminates the space
  Where your memory still fills the place.
  I know you won’t be walking in,
  But I can’t let the darkness win.
  So I keep it burning bright…
  My ghostlight.
  
  [Verse 2]
  I’ve tried to close the curtains slowly,
  Tried to sweep this stage of you.
  But the dust keeps rising softly,
  Tracing all we couldn’t do.
  And though the seats are cold and empty,
  I replay the lines we wrote —
  Every laugh and every heartbreak
  Still rehearsed in every note.
  
  [Pre-Chorus]
  I know the show is over,
  But I can’t dim what still remains.
  
  [Chorus]
  You’re my ghostlight —
  The little flame I leave on when the world slips into night.
  A quiet glow that illuminates the space
  Where your memory still fills this place.
  I know you won’t be walking in,
  But I can’t let the darkness win.
  So I keep it burning bright…
  My ghostlight.
  
  [Bridge]
  Maybe someday I’ll switch it off
  And let the shadows have their turn.
  Maybe someday I’ll walk away
  From all the things that still burn.
  But tonight I need the comfort
  Of the glow you left behind —
  A single light to guide me
  Through all the corners of my mind.
  
  [Final Chorus]
  You’re my ghostlight —
  Still shining brightly while I’m learning to be alright.
  A quiet flame that anchors this place
  Where I loved you more than time or space.
  I can feel you won’t be back again,
  But letting go takes strength I still don’t have 
  So I’ll keep it burning bright…
  My ghostlight.
  
  [Outro]
  One light left on the stage…
  Waiting for the day I’m ready to let go.
