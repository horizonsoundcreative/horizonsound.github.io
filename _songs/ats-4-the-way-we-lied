  Official audio for “The Way We Lied” by Horizon Sound.

  “The Way We Lied” is a slow, aching emotional pop ballad shaped by warm expressive female vocals, soft piano, warm strings, and spacious reverb. It captures the heavy truth of a love that faded long before either person was willing to admit it — a relationship held together by hope, denial, and silence.
  
  The song follows two people pretending they’re still okay, painting over cracks, brushing aside tears, and calling heartbreak “just a bruise.” The real truth sits in the quiet moments — the distance at the table, the promises neither of them believes anymore. It’s a confession of the ways we cling to something already slipping away, and the pain of finally facing what’s been true all along.
  
  🎧 Vibe: slow, heavy, emotional
  🎤 Vocals: warm female lead, rich tone, intimate delivery
  🎛️ Production: soft piano, warm strings, light drums, atmospheric reverb
  ⚡ Mood: aching, reflective, quietly devastating

  [INTRO]
  We said we were alright…
  Even when the truth was breaking
  
  [VERSE 1]
  We told ourselves the fire lingered,
  Even when the embers died.
  We held hands like perfect strangers
  Trying hard to justify
  Every silence at the table,
  Every tear we brushed aside —
  Calling distance “just a rough patch,” 
  Calling heartbreak “just a bruise.”
  
  [PRE‑CHORUS]
  But the truth was in the silence,
  In the things we didn’t say.
  
  [CHORUS]
  That’s the way we lied —
  Saying anything to keep a fading love alive.
  Convincing ourselves that we were fine,
  When we both knew we were running out of time.
  We painted over every crack,
  Pretending we could find our way back.
  But we were breaking from inside…
  That’s the way we lied.
  
  [VERSE 2]
  We told ourselves we’d fix it later,
  But later never came.
  We held on to fading moments,
  Watching as each one slipped away.
  You said you’d try harder,
  I said I’d learn to bend —
  But we both knew we’d stopped believing
  Long before we reached this end.
  
  [PRE‑CHORUS]
  And the truth kept getting louder
  Slowly drowning out the lies.
  
  [CHORUS]
  That’s the way we lied —
  Saying anything to keep a fading love alive.
  Convincing ourselves that we were fine,
  When we both knew we were running out of time.
  We painted over every crack,
  Pretending we could find our way back.
  But we were breaking from inside…
  That’s the way we lied.
  
  [BRIDGE]
  Maybe we were scared to see
  The life we built was gone.
  Maybe loving you meant staying
  Long after our hearts moved on.
  And maybe truth cut far too deep
  For hearts already worn.
  
  [CHORUS]
  That’s the way we lied —
  Saying anything to keep a fading love alive.
  Convincing ourselves that we were fine,
  When we both knew we were running out of time.
  We painted over every crack,
  Pretending we could find our way back.
  But we were breaking from inside…
  That’s the way we lied.
  
  [OUTRO]
  We said we were alright…
  But we never were.
