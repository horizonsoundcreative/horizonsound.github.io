lyrics: |
  [Intro]
  We gave it all, but sometimes love just fades,
  Two honest hearts walking different ways.
  No hard feelings, just a quiet truth—
  Now we’re learning how to start brand new.
  
  [Verse 1]
  Woke up slower, silence hanging in the room,
  Trying to make peace with the things I can’t undo.
  Realized I took us for granted on the way—
  Now I’m learning how to face myself today.
  
  [Pre Chorus]
  I’m not holding onto what we couldn’t save,
  Just thinking ’bout the times I wasn’t there.
  A little space, a little honesty—
  And I’m feeling more like me.
  
  [Chorus]
  I’m opening up, changing priorities,
  Learning to see what others need.
  I’m choosing me tonight.
  (I’m choosing me tonight.)
  No hard feelings, just a little more truth—
  For me to change, I’ve got to grow.
  Yeah, I’m— choosing me.
  
  [Verse 2]
  I’ve been feeling you every place I go,
  But it’s fading fast as I learn to grow.
  I’m still haunted, but I can see the light,
  Didn’t expect this strength to feel so right.
  
  [Pre Chorus]
  It’s not about the love we couldn’t keep,
  It’s learning to be the man I’m meant to be.
  A little truth, a little clarity—
  And I’m slowly finding my way back to me.
  
  [Chorus]
  I’m opening up, changing priorities,
  Learning to see what others need.
  I’m choosing me tonight.
  (I’m choosing me tonight.)
  No hard feelings, just a little more truth—
  For me to change, I’ve got to grow.
  Yeah, I’m— choosing me.
  
  [Bridge]
  I wasn’t there in the ways I meant to be,
  But I understand now why I pulled away.
  Got a little wiser, got a little light—
  And I’m leaning in to what feels right.
  
  [Chorus]
  I’m opening up, changing priorities,
  Learning to see what others need.
  I’m choosing me tonight.
  (I’m choosing me tonight.)
  No hard feelings, just a little more truth—
  For me to change, I’ve got to grow.
  Yeah, I’m choosing me tonight.
  I’m— choosing me.
  
  [Outro]
  We’re moving on, and maybe that’s alright,
  Two honest hearts stepping into new light.
  No hard feelings, just a quiet release—
  And we’re both finding our own kind of peace.

lyrics: |
  [Intro]
  We gave it all, but sometimes love just fades,
  Two honest hearts walking different ways.
  No hard feelings, just a quiet truth—
  Now we’re learning how to start brand new.
  
  [Verse 1]
  Woke up easy, sunlight dancing on my face,
  Coffee on the counter, quiet filling up the space.
  Didn’t know I missed the way the mornings used to feel—
  Guess being alone is finally helping me heal.
  
  [Pre Chorus]
  I’m not running from the memories we made,
  Just realizing I’m better with a little more space.
  A little breath, a little room to see—
  And I’m starting to come back to me.
  
  [Chorus]
  I’m finally breathing, letting my soul shine,
  Finding pieces of myself I left behind,
  I’m choosing me tonight.
  (I’m choosing me tonight.)
  No hard feelings, just a little more peace,
  Learning to embrace the girl I used to be—
  Yeah, I’m choosing me.
  
  [Verse 2]
  I’ve been laughing at the little things again,
  Dancing in the kitchen, calling up old friends.
  Didn’t know how much I’d lost along the way—
  Now I’m taking back the colors I let fade.
  
  [Pre Chorus]
  It’s not about the love we couldn’t keep,
  It’s waking up to things I’d put off too long.
  A little hope, a little clarity—
  And I’m finally where I’m meant to be.
  
  [Chorus]
  I’m finally breathing, letting my soul shine,
  Finding pieces of myself I left behind,
  I’m choosing me tonight.
  (I’m choosing me tonight.)
  No hard feelings, just a little more peace,
  Learning to embrace the girl I used to be—
  Yeah, I’m choosing me.
  
  [Bridge]
  I’m not closing any doors, just opening my own,
  Learning I can walk a little farther on my own.
  Got a little stronger, got a little light—
  And I’m holding onto what feels right.
  
  [Chorus]
  I’m finally breathing, letting my soul shine,
  Finding pieces of myself I left behind,
  I’m choosing me tonight.
  (I’m choosing me tonight.)
  No hard feelings, just a little more peace,
  Learning to embrace the girl I used to be—
  Yeah, I’m choosing me tonight.
  I’m choosing me.
  
  [Outro]
  We’re moving on, and maybe that’s alright,
  Two honest hearts stepping into new light.
  No hard feelings, just a quiet release—
  And we’re both finding our own kind of peace.

      <p>[Verse]<br>
      You say the world is a place to explore,
      You get a thrill from the race and the roar.
      Then you’re in it,
      We’re so in it…
      Then suddenly you leave—
      A summer you swore you’d never forget,
      When fall comes around, you don’t feel it yet.
      How do I take that? 
      I’m so displaced now,
      When you leave me.</p>
      
      <p>[Chorus]<br>
      You know
      I can't see all around the world
      Can't see all around the world without you
      (All around the world)
      Can't see all around the world
      You know
      I can't see all around the world
      Can't see all around the world without you
      (All around the world)
      Can't see all around the world</p>
      
      <p>[Verse]<br>
      I have a routine when I put on my face,
      Try to cover it up so I don’t look the same.
      Then it’s foundation,
      Eyes,
      Lips…
      Then I’m brand new.
      But you show up saying, “Hey,
      I’ve got someone in mind for you today —
      The one you think of
      All of the time,
      Who would take you out,
      Who would treat you right…
      The way he should.”</p>
      
      <p>[Bridge]<br>
      Maybe I was chasing you too far,
      Running circles ’round your shooting star.
      But every place you showed me how to see
      Is still a map that leads me back to me.
      
      <p>[Chorus]<br>
      You know
      I can see all around the world,
      But it’s different than it was with you.
      (All around the world)
      I’m learning what is true.
      You know
      I can see all around the world,
      Even if I miss the view I knew.
      (All around the world)
      I’m finding something new.</p>
      
      <p>[Outro]<br>
      All around the world…
      I’m still moving.
      All around the world…
      I’m still choosing.
      All around the world…
      I’m finding me.</p>

      <p>[Verse]<br>
      In a crowded delivery room<br>
      A nurse says to the new mother “Congratulations, It's a boy."<br>
      But if they had been listening<br>
      They would have heard her little voice saying<br>
      "Mama, It's me. It's your daughter, the one you always wanted."<br>
      It's been a journey to here, but she's here now<br>
      Laying in your arms—<br>
      A new beginning</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]<br>
      But it all began with that quiet little voice that always knew who she was<br>
      And it was the courage to listen that got her here today</p>
  
      <p>[Verse]<br>
      And that quiet little voice turned into hormones that slowly started to soften her features<br>
      She began to see herself for the first time<br>
      Her new reflection began to match her soul<br>
      That quiet little voice was replaced with the confidence to speak up and be heard<br>
      The confidence to finally say yes to the boy that she had been seeing and to love him fully<br>
      To let herself be loved<br>
      The quiet little voice turned into their loud declaration of love</p>
  
      <p>[Chorus]<br>
      And that love turned into an engagement<br>
      And the engagement will turn into a marriage<br>
      And one day<br>
      That marriage will bring forth new life</p>
  
      <p>[Verse]<br>
      In a crowded delivery room<br>
      A nurse will say to her<br>
      "Congratulations<br>
      It's a girl."<br>
      But she'll already know<br>
      Because she learned a long time ago to always listen to that quiet little voice<br>
      Because it was that voice that knew the whole time<br>
      And it was that voice that got her here today</p>
  
      <p>[Outro]<br>
      A new beginning</p>
