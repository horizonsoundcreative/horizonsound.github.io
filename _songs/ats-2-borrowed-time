  Official audio for “Borrowed Time” by Horizon Sound.

  “Borrowed Time” is a tender, mid‑tempo emotional pop ballad shaped by warm expressive female vocals, soft piano, gentle strings, and a nostalgic cinematic glow. It carries a bittersweet rise, balancing tenderness with the ache of knowing something beautiful was never meant to last.
  
  The song tells the story of loving someone you always knew you couldn’t keep. Every moment felt temporary, every kiss a small miracle borrowed from a future where the ending was already written. She holds on anyway — choosing fleeting warmth over emptiness — even as she feels the distance growing. It’s a confession of loving in the shadows of inevitability, and cherishing the seconds that were never really hers.
  
  🎧 Vibe: tender, nostalgic, bittersweet
  🎤 Vocals: warm female lead, smooth vibrato, emotional phrasing

  [INTRO]
  I always knew the clock was ticking,
  But I held on to the moment anyway.
  
  [VERSE 1]
  You were sunlight in the winter,
  Warmth I never thought I’d feel.
  Every touch was temporary,
  But it all felt so unreal.
  I could see the ending coming,
  Like a shadow on the floor—
  Still I held you like a secret
  I’d be foolish to ignore.
  
  [PRE‑CHORUS]
  I knew the ending waited,
  Somewhere just beyond your smile.
  
  [CHORUS]
  We were living on borrowed time—
  Holding on to seconds that were never really mine.
  Every kiss, every night,
  Was a moment I kept stealing from the light.
  I knew someday you’d draw the line,
  But I stayed anyway, pretending you were mine.
  Love that wasn’t built to last…
  Still felt worth the borrowed time.
  
  [VERSE 2]
  You were always half a promise,
  Half a dream I couldn’t keep.
  But I chose the fleeting magic
  Over nights of dreamless sleep.
  I could feel you drifting slowly,
  Like a tide that won’t return—
  But I held on to the embers
  Just to feel a little burn.
  
  [PRE‑CHORUS]
  I knew the ending was coming,
  But I held on to what we had.
  
  [CHORUS]
  We were living on borrowed time—
  Holding on to seconds that were never really mine.
  Every kiss, every night,
  Was a moment I kept stealing from the light.
  I knew someday you’d draw the line,
  But I stayed anyway, pretending you were mine.
  Love that wasn’t built to last…
  Still felt worth the borrowed time.
  
  [BRIDGE]
  Maybe loving you was choosing
  Beauty over what was true.
  Maybe I was meant to lose you
  Just to learn what love can do.
  And though the ending still reminds me
  How the sweetest things can fade—
  I don’t regret a single heartbeat
  Of the moments that we made.
  
  [CHORUS]
  We were living on borrowed time—
  And I’d do it all again just to feel your hand in mine.
  Every kiss, every night,
  Was a spark that made the darkness feel like light.
  I knew someday you’d draw the line,
  But I stayed anyway, pretending you were mine.
  Some loves only last a while…
  But they’re worth the borrowed time.
  
  [OUTRO]
  I always knew the clock was ticking…
  But I loved you while I could.
