lyrics: |
  [Verse 1]
  I used to fear change, I tried to keep it still
  Worried every bad decision meant I’d never find my way
  But nothing stays the same, and maybe that’s ok
  The colors only come alive when patterns start to play
  
  [Pre Chorus]
  So when the world tilts sideways
  And I don’t know what comes next
  I remind myself that motion
  Doesn’t mean my life’s a mess
  
  [Chorus]
  Life’s a kaleidoscope, changing with each day
  Every shape and color shifting into place
  When the bright goes dark, when everything falls apart
  I just breathe and let it go
  Every day… another turn of the kaleidoscope
  
  [Verse 2]
  I’ve seen the best things fade, and the worst things bloom
  Lost a little faith, then found it in a different view
  The things that once hurt me now fall into a new design
  Sometimes the fractured pieces form a pattern over time
  
  [Pre Chorus]
  So when my vision trembles
  And the colors rearrange
  I remind myself that happiness 
  sometimes needs a little change
  
  [Chorus]
  Life’s a kaleidoscope, changing with each day
  Every shape and color shifting into place
  When the bright goes dark, when everything falls apart
  I just breathe and let it go
  Every day… another turn of the kaleidoscope
  
  [Bridge]
  You can’t freeze the perfect moment
  You often stay inside the pain
  Every turn becomes a chance
  Every flicker finds its flame
  And the light keeps finding new ways
  To start to shine through
  
  [Chorus]
  Life’s a kaleidoscope, changing with each day
  Every shape and color shifting into place
  When the bright goes dark, when everything falls apart
  I just breathe and let it go
  Every day… another turn of the kaleidoscope
  
  [Outro]
  Every day… another turn of the kaleidoscope
