  Official audio for "Total Eclipse - Years Later" by Horizon Sound.
  
  “Total Eclipse - Years Later” is paying tribute to the story in a Total Eclipse of the Heart. It tries to imagine where she might be years later. It is a piano‑driven, 80s‑inspired ballad with soft, intimate verses and a gradual emotional build. The piano stays at the center while warm strings and gated‑reverb drums rise in slowly, creating a nostalgic, cinematic atmosphere. The vocal is a strong but controlled female rock performance — expressive, warm, and raspy without shouting.
  
  The song tells the story of someone reclaiming their strength after a painful past, stepping out of old shadows and into their own light. With its reflective verses, powerful choruses, and the recurring phrase “turn around” delivered in a soft‑to‑strong dynamic, the track captures the moment of finally seeing yourself clearly and choosing a new path forward.

  [INTRO]
  Turn around…
  Every now and then I think about how close I came to breaking—
  Turn around…
  And every now and then it hits me how far I’ve finally come.
  
  [VERSE 1]
  I remember how it felt then,
  Every instinct telling me to flee,
  You were a wildfire on the horizon,
  A heat that swallowed me.
  I kept losing all my courage,
  Too afraid to stand on my own.
  I was breaking just to keep you,
  Terrified of facing life alone.
  But time has a way of showing
  What the heart can’t see at all.
  
  [PRE‑CHORUS]
  Turn around…
  I hear it now, my own voice breaking through the dark—
  Turn around…
  All the pieces I’d been hiding
  Came rushing back to me—
  You were never the one I needed.
  
  [CHORUS]
  I don’t break the way I used to,
  I don’t fall into the dark.
  I found the strength I thought I’d lost
  Burning deep inside my heart.
  I’m not living in your shadow,
  I’m standing in my own light.
  What once pulled me under
  Can’t hold me down tonight.
  
  [VERSE 2]
  There was a night I finally saw it—
  The reflection I was afraid to face.
  All the pieces I’d been hiding
  Fell together into place.
  Then I walked out of the wreckage,
  Left the ruins where they lay.
  Took a breath that felt like freedom,
  And let myself feel whole again.
  And now the world looks different,
  Bathed in colors I never knew.
  
  [PRE‑CHORUS]
  Turn around…
  I’m stepping from the past,
  Toward the life I’m building today—
  Turn around…
  I’m finding my voice at last,
  And learning to live in my own way.
  
  [CHORUS]
  I don’t break the way I used to,
  I don’t fall into the dark.
  I found the strength I was missing 
  Every time you touched my heart.
  I’m not living in your shadow,
  I’ve stepped out into the light.
  What once pulled me under
  Can’t hold me down tonight.
  
  [BRIDGE]
  I don’t hate the way we ended,
  I don’t wish the past away.
  You were thunder, you were chaos,
  But you taught me how to rise.
  Not with you, but with myself now—
  And that’s the woman I grew into.
  
  [CHORUS]
  I don’t break the way I used to,
  I don’t fall into the dark.
  I found the strength I was missing 
  Every time you touched my heart.
  I’m not living in your shadow,
  I’ve stepped out into the light.
  What once pulled me under
  Can’t hold me down tonight—
  I’m finally alive.
  
  [OUTRO]
  Turn around…
  I know what to do now,
  And I’m never in the dark—
  Turn around…
  There’s nothing left to prove,
  And I’m finally standing on my own.
