lyrics: |
  [Intro]
  My phone’s blowing up, I can barely hear,
  My girls on FaceTime screaming in my ear.
  My lip gloss shining, catching the light—
  Yeah, we’re trouble, we were made to ignite.
  
  [Verse 1]
  Clothes on the floor, I’ve tried on twenty fits,
  Someone’s crying, someone’s drunk, someone’s losing it.
  Music blasting, neighbors banging on the door,
  But tonight we’re legends, — 
  We won’t be ignored!
  
  [Pre-Chorus]
  Mirror saying “Girl, you’re the main event,”
  Spent all day on my look, this glow’s no accident.
  Heels too high, but I’ll make ’em mine—
  Countdown’s starting, and we’re right on time.
  
  [Chorus]
  Before midnight, we’re glowing, glowing,
  Swagger is rising and it’s showing, showing. 
  Group chat going wild, and we’re losing our minds—
  We’re the flame that’s gonna light up the night.
  Before midnight, we’re reckless, reckless,
  Insanity breaking loose and it’s endless, endless. 
  One last look, then we step outside—
  Yeah, the world won’t see me coming tonight.
  
  
  [Verse 2]
  Glitter on my skin, I’m ready to rage,
  Girls gather around, about to engage.
  “Take a pic!” “No, delete!” “Wait, I look insane!”
  We’re magic in the madness — that’s the whole damn thing.
  
  [Pre-Chorus]
  Uber’s waiting, someone’s yelling “GO!”
  We’re late as hell, but we still steal the show.
  Heels on pavement, neon lighting up our eyes—
  Tonight we’re trouble and we don’t apologize.
  
  [Chorus]
  Before midnight, we’re glowing, glowing,
  Swagger is rising and it’s showing, showing. 
  Group chat going wild, and we’re losing our minds—
  We’re the flame that’s gonna light up the night.
  Before midnight, we’re reckless, reckless,
  Insanity breaking loose and it’s endless, endless. 
  One last look, then we step outside—
  Yeah, the world won’t see me coming tonight.
  
  [Bridge]
  Laughter spilling over, we’re drawing a crowd,
  Yelling “Drive faster!” — we’re losing it now.
  Girls all screaming, we’re alive, alive—
  We’re all preparing to dive.
  
  [Chorus]
  Before midnight, we’re glowing, glowing,
  Swagger is rising and it’s showing, showing. 
  Group chat going wild, and we’re losing our minds—
  We’re the flame that’s gonna light up the night.
  Before midnight, we’re reckless, reckless,
  Insanity breaking loose and it’s endless, endless. 
  One last look, then we step outside—
  Yeah, the world won’t see me coming tonight.
  
  [Outro]
  The Uber pulls up and my girls spill out,
  The bass is thumping as we rush inside.
  We get in for free ’cause we’re what it’s about—
  This club is so damn epic, yeah—
  We’re losing our minds tonight.
