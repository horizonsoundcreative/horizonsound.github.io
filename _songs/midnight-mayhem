  [Intro]
  Let the chaos flow.
  
  [Verse 1]
  Neon dripping off my body like a cosmic waterfall,
  I walk in and every heel click starts a riot in the hall.
  Got confetti in my lashes, got a dare behind my grin,
  If you’re looking for a quiet night—
  don’t let me in.
  I’m a spark in a powder room, a queen about to blow,
  And the second that the bass hits, I’m electric to the bone.
  
  [Pre‑Chorus]
  Turn it up ’til the walls start bending,
  We don’t stop — we just keep ascending.
  Hands in the air like we’re touching the sky,
  This whole place ’bout to amplify.
  
  [Chorus]
  We’re making midnight mayhem, watch the whole world shake,
  Every move we’re making leaves a glitter quake.
  Lights go wild when we hit the floor —
  One scream, one beat — now they’re begging for more.
  We’re reckless, restless, ready to blow,
  Turn the night up louder, let the chaos flow
  
  [Verse 2]
  Silver lipstick on a stranger, girlfriends dancing on the bar,
  I’m a hurricane in heels and I’m a wish upon a star.
  Got a pocket full of trouble and a rhythm in my veins,
  Every step I take is thunder—
  I won’t be contained.
  If you’re craving something dangerous, then baby, here I am —
  A firework in human form, a one girl traffic jam.
  
  [Pre‑Chorus]
  Turn it up ’til the room starts spinning,
  We’re not losing — insane is winning.
  Bodies collide like a sensual tide,
  We’re the storm they can’t survive.
  
  [Chorus]
  We’re making midnight mayhem, let the whole world shake,
  Every move we’re making leaves a glitter quake.
  Lights go wild when we hit the floor —
  One scream, one beat, and they’re begging for more.
  We’re reckless, restless, ready to blow,
  Turn the night up louder, let the chaos flow.
  
  [Bridge]
  Flashbulbs popping like a meteor shower,
  We’re the kind of wild you can’t overpower.
  Spin me reckless, pull me under —
  Let the night explode like thunder.
  
  [Chorus]
  We’re making midnight mayhem, watch the whole world shake,
  Every move we’re making leaves a glitter quake.
  Lights go wild when we hit the floor —
  One scream, one beat — now they’re begging for more.
  We’re reckless, restless, ready to blow,
  Turn the night up louder, let the chaos flow.
  
  [Outro]
  Let the chaos flow, let the chaos flow—
  One spark, one night, and we’re ready to blow.
