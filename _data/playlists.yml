  description: >
    A three-part emotional arc exploring silence, self-worth, and the courage
    to choose yourself — or choose your way back home. Told from two
    perspectives, this trilogy follows the quiet unraveling of a relationship,
    the rediscovery of identity, and the moment two people decide whether to
    walk away or walk toward each other again.
