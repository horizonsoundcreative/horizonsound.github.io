  Official audio for "Gimme Three Steps, and I’m Gone" by Horizon Sound.
  
  “Gimme Three Steps, and I’m Gone” is a high‑energy 70s‑style Southern‑rock chase through barroom chaos, gritty electric guitars, and swaggering shuffle drums. Blues‑drenched riffs, harmonized leads, and a driving, good‑time groove fuel this runaway anthem. With cinematic tension, rowdy humor, and a classic back‑alley escape vibe, the track channels the spirit of a night gone wildly wrong.
  
  This song follows a fast‑talking trouble‑magnet who bolts out the back door of a bar after being mistaken for the guy who wrecked a pool game and skipped out on a bet. Surrounded by angry bikers, he pleads his innocence while trying to outrun the mess he never meant to be part of. Urgent, playful, and full of Southern swagger, “Gimme Three Steps, and I’m Gone” is a modern spin on the bar‑fight storytelling tradition.

lyrics: |
  [Verse 1]
  I hit that back door runnin’, 
  boots poundin’ on the alley stone,
  Heart beatin’ like a kick drum
  Screamin’ “boy, get gone!”
  Swore I’d learned my lesson,
  But trouble always finds me
  Rounded past the dumpsters, 
  thinkin’ I was finally free,
  Heard a roar of voices — 
  Every one turned toward me.
  
  [Pre‑Chorus]
  A dozen bikers, tempers flarin’,
  I’m standin’ where I shouldn’t be.
  I know that look, I’ve seen that stare —
  Lord, this night ain’t done with me.
  
  [Chorus]
  Gimme three steps, boys,
  I ain’t your man.
  Didn’t break your cue,
  didn’t touch your cash.
  I ain’t the guy
  you’re lookin’ for.
  ’Fore this thing blows up—
  gimme three steps,
  and I’m gone.
  
  [Verse 2]
  One big fella points at me,
  says I’m the man who fled.
  “There’s the fool who ducked out back
  when he couldn’t cover his bet!”
  Another waves a wad of cash,
  holdin’ court out in the street.
  They’re swearin’ I’m the reason
  their whole damn team got beat.
  I’m tryin’ to talk my way out,
  but nobody hears me speak.
  They’re closin’ in like I’m the villain
  in a pool‑hall showdown scene.
  
  [Pre‑Chorus]
  I’m inchin’ toward the exit, 
  prayin’ they don’t block my way,
  Swearin’ up and down I’m innocent —
  But they ain’t buyin’ what I say.
  
  [Chorus]
  Gimme three steps, boys,
  I ain’t your man.
  Didn’t break your cue,
  didn’t touch your cash.
  I ain’t the guy
  you’re lookin’ for.
  ’Fore this thing blows up—
  gimme three steps,
  and I’m gone.
  
  [Bridge]
  Maybe I should quit these bars,
  stop dancin’ with girls I don’t know.
  Maybe I should head home early,
  try to straighten out my ways—
  but I’ll end up runnin’ anyway.
  
  [Chorus]
  Gimme three steps, boys,
  I ain’t your man.
  Didn’t break your cue,
  didn’t touch your cash.
  I ain’t the guy
  you’re lookin’ for.
  ’Fore this thing blows up—
  gimme three steps,
  and I’m gone.
  
  [Outro]
  Hit the street and caught my breath,
  thought maybe I’d outrun the night.
  Then someone hollered, “Hey, you!”
  and I whispered, “Aw hell… not tonight.”
