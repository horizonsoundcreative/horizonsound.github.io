lyrics: |
  [Intro]
  We gave it all, but sometimes love just fades,
  Two honest hearts walking different ways.
  No hard feelings, just a quiet truth—
  Now we’re learning how to start brand new.
  
  [Verse 1]
  Woke up slower, silence hanging in the room,
  Trying to make peace with the things I can’t undo.
  Realized I took us for granted on the way—
  Now I’m learning how to face myself today.
  
  [Pre Chorus]
  I’m not holding onto what we couldn’t save,
  Just thinking ’bout the times I wasn’t there.
  A little space, a little honesty—
  And I’m feeling more like me.
  
  [Chorus]
  I’m opening up, changing priorities,
  Learning to see what others need.
  I’m choosing me tonight.
  (I’m choosing me tonight.)
  No hard feelings, just a little more truth—
  For me to change, I’ve got to grow.
  Yeah, I’m— choosing me.
  
  [Verse 2]
  I’ve been feeling you every place I go,
  But it’s fading fast as I learn to grow.
  I’m still haunted, but I can see the light,
  Didn’t expect this strength to feel so right.
  
  [Pre Chorus]
  It’s not about the love we couldn’t keep,
  It’s learning to be the man I’m meant to be.
  A little truth, a little clarity—
  And I’m slowly finding my way back to me.
  
  [Chorus]
  I’m opening up, changing priorities,
  Learning to see what others need.
  I’m choosing me tonight.
  (I’m choosing me tonight.)
  No hard feelings, just a little more truth—
  For me to change, I’ve got to grow.
  Yeah, I’m— choosing me.
  
  [Bridge]
  I wasn’t there in the ways I meant to be,
  But I understand now why I pulled away.
  Got a little wiser, got a little light—
  And I’m leaning in to what feels right.
  
  [Chorus]
  I’m opening up, changing priorities,
  Learning to see what others need.
  I’m choosing me tonight.
  (I’m choosing me tonight.)
  No hard feelings, just a little more truth—
  For me to change, I’ve got to grow.
  Yeah, I’m choosing me tonight.
  I’m— choosing me.
  
  [Outro]
  We’re moving on, and maybe that’s alright,
  Two honest hearts stepping into new light.
  No hard feelings, just a quiet release—
  And we’re both finding our own kind of peace.
